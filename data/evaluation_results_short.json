This Regulation establishes rules designed to achieve the free movement of detergents and surfactants for detergents in the internal market while, at the same time, ensuring a high degree of protection of the environment and human health.\n2. For this purpose, this Regulation harmonises the following rules for the placing on the market of detergents and of surfactants for detergents:\n- the biodegradability of surfactants in detergents;\n- restrictions or bans on surfactants on grounds of biodegradability;\n- the additional labelling of detergents, including fragrance allergens; and\n- the information that manufacturers must hold at the disposal of the Member States competent authorities and medical personnel.\n\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation:\n1. \"Detergent\" means any substance or preparation containing soaps and/or other surfactants intended for washing and cleaning processes. Detergents may be in any form (liquid, powder, paste, bar, cake, moulded piece, shape, etc.) and marketed for or used in household, or institutional or industrial purposes.\nOther products to be considered as detergents are:\n- \"Auxiliary washing preparation\", intended for soaking (pre-washing), rinsing or bleaching clothes, household linen, etc.;\n- \"Laundry fabric-softener\", intended to modify the feel of fabrics in processes which are to complement the washing of fabrics;\n- \"Cleaning preparation\", intended for domestic all purposes cleaners and/or other cleaning of surfaces (e.g.: materials, products, machinery, mechanical appliances, means of transport and associated equipment, instruments, apparatus, etc.);\n- \"Other cleaning and washing preparations\", intended for any other washing and cleaning processes.\n2. \"Washing\" means the cleaning of laundry, fabrics, dishes and other hard surfaces.\n3. \"Cleaning\" has the meaning defined by EN ISO 862.\n4. \"Substance\" means chemical elements and their compounds in the natural state or obtained by any production process, including any additive necessary to preserve the stability of the products and any impurity deriving from the process used, but excluding any solvent which may be separated without affecting the stability of the substance or changing its composition.\n5. \"Preparation\" means a mixture or solution composed of two or more substances.\n6. \"Surfactant\" means any organic substance and/or preparation used in detergents, which has surface-active properties and which consists of one or more hydrophilic and one or more hydrophobic groups of such a nature and size that it is capable of reducing the surface tension of water, and of forming spreading or adsorption monolayers at the water-air interface, and of forming emulsions and/or microemulsions and/or micelles, and of adsorption at water-solid interfaces.\n7. \"Primary biodegradation\" means the structural change (transformation) of a surfactant by micro-organisms resulting in the loss of its surface-active properties due to the degradation of the parent substance and consequential loss of the surface-active property as measured by test methods listed in Annex II.\n8. \"Ultimate aerobic biodegradation\" means the level of biodegradation achieved when the surfactant is totally used by micro-organisms in the presence of oxygen resulting in its breakdown to carbon dioxide, water and mineral salts of any other elements present (mineralisation), as measured by test methods listed in Annex III, and new microbial cellular constituents (biomass).\n9. \"Placing on the market\" means introducing onto the Community market, thereby making available to third parties, whether in exchange for payment or not. Import into the Community customs territory shall be deemed to be placing on the market.\n10. \"Manufacturer\" means the natural or legal person responsible for placing a detergent or a surfactant for a detergent on the market; in particular, a producer, an importer, a packager working for his own account, or any person changing the characteristics of a detergent or of a surfactant for a detergent, or creating or changing the labelling thereof, shall be deemed to be a manufacturer. A distributor who does not change the characteristics, labelling or packaging of a detergent, or of a surfactant for a detergent, shall not be deemed to be a manufacturer, except where he acts as an importer.\n11. \"Medical personnel\" means a registered medical practitioner, or a person working under the direction of a registered medical practitioner, acting to provide patient care, make a diagnosis or administer treatment, and who is bound by professional confidentiality.\n12. \"Industrial and institutional detergent\" means a detergent for washing and cleaning outside the domestic sphere, carried out by specialised personnel using specific products.\n\nArticle 3\nThe placing on the market\n1. When placed on the market, detergents and surfactants for detergents referred to in Article 1 shall conform with the conditions, characteristics and limits laid down in this Regulation and its Annexes and, where relevant, with Directive 98/8/EC and with any other relevant Community legislation. Surfactants that are also active substances within the meaning of Directive 98/8/EC and that are used as disinfectants are exempt from the provisions of Annexes II, III, IV and VIII of this Regulation provided:\n(a) they are listed in Annex I or IA of Directive 98/8/EC, or\n(b) they are constituents of biocidal products authorised under Article 15(1) or 15(2) of Directive 98/8/EC, or\n(c) they are constituents of biocidal products allowed under the transitional measures or subject to the 10 year work programme provided for in Article 16 of Directive 98/8/EC.\nInstead, such surfactants are deemed to be disinfectants and the detergents of which they are ingredients are subject to the labelling provisions for disinfectants of Annex VII A.\n2. Manufacturers of detergents and/or of surfactants for detergents shall be established within the Community.\n3. Manufacturers shall be responsible for the conformity of detergents and/or of surfactants for detergents with the provisions of this Regulation and its Annexes.\n\nArticle 4\nLimitations based on the biodegradability of surfactants\n1. Under this Regulation, surfactants and detergents containing surfactants that meet the criteria for ultimate aerobic biodegradation as laid down in Annex III may be placed on the market without further limitations relating to biodegradability.\n2. If a detergent contains surfactants for which the level of ultimate aerobic biodegradation is lower than that stipulated in Annex III, manufacturers of industrial or institutional detergents containing surfactants, and/or of surfactants for industrial or institutional detergents, may ask for derogation. Requests for derogation shall be made and decided in accordance with Articles 5, 6 and 9.\n3. The level of primary biodegradability shall be measured for all surfactants in detergents failing ultimate aerobic biodegradation tests. Detergent surfactants, for which the level of primary biodegradability is lower than that stipulated in Annex II, shall not be granted derogation.\n",

This excludes medicinal products as defined by Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use(13), pharmaceutical preparations, mixtures, natural products and other preparations containing scheduled substances that are compounded in such a way that they cannot be easily used or extracted by readily applicable or economically viable means;\n(b) \"non-scheduled substance\" means any substance which, although not listed in Annex I, is identified as having been used for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances;\n(c) \"placing on the market\" means any supply, whether in return for payment or free of charge, of scheduled substances in the Community; or the storage, manufacture, production, processing, trade, distribution or brokering of these substances for the purpose of supply in the Community;\n(d) \"operator\" means any natural or legal person engaged in the placing on the market of scheduled substances;\n(e) \"International Narcotics Control Board\" means the Board established by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, as amended by the 1972 Protocol;\n(f) \"special licence\" means a licence that is granted to a particular type of operator;\n(g) \"special registration\" means a registration that is made for a particular type of operator.\n\nArticle 3\nRequirements for the placing on the market of scheduled substances\n1. Operators wishing to place on the market scheduled substances of categories 1 and 2 of Annex I shall be required to appoint an officer responsible for the trade in scheduled substances, to notify the competent authorities of the name and contact details of that officer and to notify them immediately of any subsequent modification of this information. The officer shall ensure that the trade in scheduled substances conducted by the operator takes place in compliance with this Regulation. The officer shall be empowered to represent the operator and to take the decisions necessary for performing the tasks specified above.\n2. Operators shall be required to obtain a licence from the competent authorities before they may possess or place on the market scheduled substances of category 1 of Annex I. Special licences may be granted by the competent authorities to pharmacies, dispensaries of veterinary medicine, certain types of public authorities or armed forces. Such special licences shall only be valid for the use of precursors within the scope of the official duties of the operators concerned.\n3. Any operator holding a licence referred to in paragraph 2 shall supply scheduled substances of category 1 of Annex I only to natural or legal persons who hold such a licence and have signed a customer declaration as provided for in Article 4(1).\n4. When considering whether to grant a licence, the competent authorities shall take into account in particular the competence and integrity of the applicant. The licence is to be refused if there are reasonable grounds for doubting the suitability and reliability of the applicant or of the officer responsible for the trade in scheduled substances. The licence may be suspended or revoked by the competent authorities whenever there are reasonable grounds for believing that the holder is no longer a fit and proper person to hold a licence, or that the conditions under which the licence was granted are no longer fulfilled.\n5. Without prejudice to Article 14, the competent authorities may either limit the validity of the licence to a period not exceeding three years or may oblige the operators to demonstrate at intervals not exceeding three years that the conditions under which the licence was granted are still fulfilled. The licence shall mention the operation or operations for which it is valid, as well as the substances concerned. Special licences within the meaning of paragraph 2 shall be granted in principle for an unlimited duration but may be suspended or revoked by the competent authorities under the conditions of paragraph 4, third sentence.\n6. Without prejudice to Article 6, operators engaged in the placing on the market of scheduled substances of category 2 of Annex I shall be required to register and update with the competent authorities without delay the addresses of the premises at which they manufacture or from which they trade in these substances, before placing them on the market. Pharmacies, dispensaries of veterinary medicine, certain types of public authorities or the armed forces may be made subject to a special registration. Such registrations shall be considered valid only for the use of precursors within the scope of the official duties of the operators concerned.\n7. The competent authorities may require operators to pay a fee for the application for a licence or a registration. Such fees shall be levied in a non-discriminatory way and shall not exceed the cost of processing the application.\n\nArticle 4\nCustomer declaration\n1. Without prejudice to Articles 6 and 14, any operator established within the Community who supplies a customer with a scheduled substance of categories 1 or 2 of Annex I shall obtain a declaration from the customer which shows the specific use or uses of the scheduled substances. A separate declaration shall be required for each scheduled substance. This declaration shall conform to the model set out in point 1 of Annex III. In the case of legal persons, the declaration shall be made on headed notepaper.\n2. As an alternative to the above declaration for an individual transaction, an operator who regularly supplies a customer with a scheduled substance of category 2 of Annex I may accept a single declaration in respect of a number of transactions involving this scheduled substance over a period not exceeding one year, provided that the operator is satisfied that the following criteria have been met:\n(a) the customer has been supplied by the operator with the substance on at least three occasions in the preceding 12 months;\n(b) the operator has no reason to suppose that the substance will be used for illicit purposes;\n(c) the quantities ordered are consistent with the usual consumption for that customer.\nThis declaration shall conform to the model set out in point 2 of Annex III. In the case of legal persons, the declaration shall be made on headed notepaper.\n3. An operator supplying scheduled substances of category 1 of Annex I shall stamp and date a copy of the declaration, certifying it to be a true copy of the original. Such copy must always accompany category 1 substances being moved within the Community and must be presented on request to the authorities responsible for checking vehicle contents during transport operations.\n",

Therefore, it is somewhat context-dependent, but not heavily reliant on external documents for understanding in an EU legal or regulatory context."

        "question": "What types of studies must a medicinal product undergo before being marketed in Member States?",
        "answer": "Pre-clinical tests and clinical trials",
        "groundedness_score": 5,
        "groundedness_eval": "The context mentions that medicinal products must undergo \"extensive studies, including pre-clinical tests and clinical trials,\" before being marketed in Member States. This directly addresses the types of studies required—specifically, pre-clinical and clinical studies. Since the question asks for the types of studies, and the context explicitly mentions these categories, it provides sufficient detail to answer the question unambiguously.",
        "relevance_score": 5,
        "relevance_eval": "This question pertains to the regulatory requirements for medicinal products within the EU, specifically regarding pre-market studies or testing necessary prior to marketing. Understanding the types of studies required involves knowledge of EU pharmaceutical regulations, such as Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or Directive 2001/83/EC, which contain specific provisions on clinical trials, safety, efficacy, and quality assessments. As such, this question is highly relevant for extracting, reasoning about, or generating legal/regulatory information related to medicinal product approval processes and compliance with EU law.",
        "standalone_score": 5,
        "standalone_eval": "The question refers specifically to regulatory requirements for the authorization of medicinal products within EU Member States. It addresses the procedural aspect of market authorization, which is governed by established EU legislation such as Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or Directive 2001/83/EC. The question does not mention any particular document, regulation, or legal article but assumes knowledge of the general context of medicinal product approval procedures in the EU. An operator or legal professional familiar with EU pharmaceutical regulation would recognize this as a standard inquiry into pre-marketing studies (such as clinical trials or other required safety and efficacy studies). Therefore, it is sufficiently self-contained within the domain of European pharmaceutical regulation."
