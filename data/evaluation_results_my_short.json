The policy has among its specific objectives to contribute to halting and reversing biodiversity loss, enhance ecosystem services and preserve habitats and landscapes. The new CAP conditionality standard Nr. 8 on Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions of Lands (GAEC 8), set out in Annex III to Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council(16), requires beneficiaries of area-related payments to have at least 4 % of arable land at farm level devoted to non-productive areas and features, such as land lying fallow, and to retain existing landscape features. The 4 % share that is to be attributed to compliance with the GAEC 8 standard can be reduced to 3 % if certain pre-requisites are met. That obligation will contribute to Member States reaching a positive trend in high-diversity landscape features on agricultural land. In addition, under the CAP, Member States have the possibility to set up eco-schemes for agricultural practices carried out by farmers on agricultural areas that may include maintenance and creation of landscape features or non-productive areas. Similarly, in their CAP strategic plans, Member States can also include agri-environment-climate commitments, including the enhanced management of landscape features going beyond the GAEC 8 standard or eco-schemes. Projects under the sub-programme ‘Nature and Biodiversity’ of the LIFE Programme, established by Regulation (EU) 2021/783 of the European Parliament and of the Council(17), will also help to put Europe’s biodiversity on agricultural land on a path to recovery by 2030, by supporting the implementation of Directives 92/43/EEC and 2009/147/EC as well as the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030.",

It shall apply to knowledge resulting from the implementation of these programmes through work undertaken direct by or financed wholly by, the Community, or work undertaken under a shared-cost contract. It shall also apply to the information concerning and relevant to such knowledge.\n2. For the purposes of this Regulation:\n(1) 'knowledge` means results and inventions, whether patentable or not, obtained either directly by the Community through its own research means, or in the execution of a research and technological development contract concluded between the Community and third parties;\n(2) 'background information` means information, excluding knowledge, and any rights related to such information, held by any contractor in the same, or related, fields of research under his or her shared-cost contract;\n(3) 'contractor` means any party which has concluded a shared-cost contract with the Community, and any affiliate of any party as defined in that contract; it shall also include, where applicable, the Community, where the latter not only funds but actually carries out part of the work under a shared-cost contract, alongside and in a similar manner to the relevant co-contractors;\n(4) 'co-contractor` means the parties having concluded the same shared-cost contract with the Community;\n(5) 'project` means one or several shared-cost contracts where the tasks covered are technically interdependent, and which the parties to those contracts agree to consider as such under contractually defined conditions;\n(6) 'programme` means any of the programmes mentioned in paragraph 1;\n(7) 'commercial conditions` means open market payment and other conditions;\n(8) 'preferential conditions` means conditions that have a value lower than commercial conditions;\n(9) 'transfer conditions` means conditions that have a value lower than preferential conditions, normally the cost of making licences and user rights available.\n\nArticle 2\n1. Knowledge resulting from work under a shared-cost contract shall be owned by the contractors who carry out the work.\n2. When two or more contractors undertake work under a shared-cost contract, they shall come to an agreement between themselves on the allocation of ownership rights over the knowledge concerned.\n3. If, under the applicable rules, the persons employed or engaged by the parties to a shared-cost contract may claim rights over the knowledge, the contractors shall take appropriate steps or reach agreement so as to ensure that such rights may be exercised in a manner compatible with the proper fulfilment of their obligations under such shared-cost contract pursuant to this Regulation.\n\nArticle 3\n1. Contractors shall ensure that knowledge belonging to them which could be used in an industrial or commercial application and whose nature justifies such a measure is protected to the extent required in the interests of the Community and of the contractors themselves and in accordance with any applicable legal or contractual obligation.\n2. At the request or with the consent of the contractors the Commission may, to the extent required in the interests of the Community and the said contractors, take adequate steps to protect the knowledge in a country of its choice, if the contractors are unable or unwilling to secure such protection on their own behalf of the knowledge belonging to them. In such an event the Commission shall take upon itself such obligations regarding the granting of licences for the use or exploitation of the knowledge in the country concerned as would have been assumed by the contractors had they protected the knowledge on their own behalf, and the contractors concerned shall be granted a non-exclusive licence in that country, under such conditions as may be set out in the shared-cost contract.\n\nArticle 4\n1. Contractors participating in the same project shall, on a royalty-free basis, make available and grant licences and user rights to each other, in respect of knowledge, to the extent necessary for the proper implementation of the work carried out under their respective shared-cost contracts.\n2. Subject to Article 16, the knowledge generated by any contractor shall be made available to other contractors participating in the same programme and necessary user rights and licences shall be granted on transfer conditions, to the extent required for the execution of such other contractor's own research and technological development work under their shared-cost contracts, provided that suitable arrangements required by the contractor are concluded to ensure that the knowledge will not be used for any other purpose than that for which it was supplied.\nThe same conditions shall apply to contractors who are taking part in other programmes in associated fields or with related objectives and who are established in the Community and engaged in research and technological development activities there, provided that their shared-cost contracts place the contractors under an obligation to grant equivalent access to their own knowledge.\n3. Any person established in the Community engaged in research and technological development activities there shall be entitled to request, on preferential conditions, any licences or user rights concerning the knowledge which are necessary for the conduct of his or her research and technological development activities in fields identical or related to that covered by the shared-cost contract through which the knowledge is obtained.\nThere shall be no refusal to grant such licences and user rights other than for reasons stipulated in the shared-cost contracts, namely the major business interests of the contractors or the interests of the Community. The granting of such licences and user rights may, however, be refused if the owner of the knowledge or any of his licensees has taken or is taking adequate steps to exploit or commercialize the knowledge in the Community.\n4. The Community shall, at its request and for research and technological development work in pursuance of Community policies conducted by its Joint Research Centre for direct action activities in accordance with Community framework programmes (namely its institutional non-competitive work) and conducted by joint undertakings or any other structure set up on the basis of Article 130n of the Treaty, be granted a royalty-free non-exclusive licence for the use of the knowledge for research purposes, but shall keep such knowledge confidential and not be entitled to grant sub-licences.\n",

In its opinion EFSA considers that it is currently not possible to evaluate the extent of public health protection provided by specific microbiological criteria for seeds and sprouted seeds.

Directive as last amended by Directive 2001/18/EC.\n(4) OJ L 214, 24.8.1993, p. 1.\nANNEX\nFORMATS FOR UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS\nThe Annex below defines the format for the unique identifier for plants in Section A and for micro-organisms and animals in Section B.\nSECTION A\n1. Overall format\nThis Annex provides details as to the format to be used for unique identifiers for GMOs pending or authorised for the placing on the market under Community legislation. The format consists of three components comprising a number of alphanumeric digits and providing reference to the applicant/consent holder, transformation event and a means for verification.\nThe format comprises nine alphanumeric digits in total. The first component represents the applicant/consent holder and comprises two or three alphanumeric digits. The second component comprises five or six alphanumeric digits and represents the transformation event. The third component provides for verification and is represented by a final numerical digit.\nThe following provides an example of a unique identifier developed using this format.\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000802.TIF\">\nor\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000803.TIF\">\nThe following sections provide guidance as to how the three individual components of the unique identifier should be developed.\n2. Applicant/consent holder component\nThe first two or three alphanumeric digits represent the applicant/consent holder (for example, the first two or three letters of the applicant/consent holder organisation name), followed by a dash, such;\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000804.TIF\">\nor\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000805.TIF\">\nApplicants may already have assigned alphanumeric digits to indicate their identity and these appear in the applicant's code table within the OECD BioTrack product database. These applicants should continue to use these digits.\nAny new applicant that is not identified within the database will not be permitted to use the existing codes listed in the applicant's code table within the database. The new applicant Should inform the national authorities, which should update the OECD BioTrack product database by including a new code (digits) that will be designed to identify the new applicant in the code table.\n3. Transformation event component\nThe second set of five or six alphanumerical digits should represent the specific transformation event(s), which is the subject of the application for the placing on the market and/or consent, such as:\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000806.TIF\">\nor\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000807.TIF\">\nClearly, an individual transformation event may occur in different organisms, species and varieties and the digits should be representative of the specific event in question. Again, applicants should, prior to formulating unique identifiers, consult the OECD BioTrack product database in terms of the unique identifiers that have been assigned to similar transformation events of the same organism/species in order to provide consistency and to avoid duplication.\nApplicants should develop their own internal mechanism to avoid applying the same designation (digits) to a \"transformation event\" if used in a different organism. Where similar transformation events are developed by two or more organisations, the \"applicant information\" (see section 2) should enable applicants to generate a unique identifier for their own product, while at the same time ensuring its uniqueness from those generated by other applicants.\nAs regards new GMOs compromising more than one transformation event (often referred to as stacked-gene transformation events), applicants or consent holders should generate a novel unique identifier for such GMOs.\n4. Verification component\nThe final digit of the unique identifier is for verification, which shall be separated from the rest of the unique identifier digits by a dash, such as:\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000901.TIF\">\nor\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000902.TIF\">\nThe verification digit is intended to reduce errors by ensuring the integrity of the alphanumeric identifier, entered by the users of the database.\nThe rule to calculate the verification digit is as follows. The verification digit is made up of a single numerical digit. It is calculated by adding together the numerical values of each of the alphanumerical digits in the unique identifier. The numerical value of each of the digits is from\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000903.TIF\">\nto 9 for the numerical digits (>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000904.TIF\">\nto 9) and 1 to 26 for the alphabetical digits (A to Z) (see sections 5 and 6). The total sum, if made up of several numerical digits, will be further calculated by adding the remaining digits together using the same rule, in an iterative process, until the final sum is a single numerical digit.\nFor example, the verification digit for the code CED-AB891 is calculated as follows:\n>TABLE>\nTherefore, the final unique identifier then becomes - CED-AB891-6.\n5. Form of digits to be used in the unique identifier\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000905.TIF\">\n6. Form of alphabetic characters to be used, plus numerical equivalents for calculating verification digit.\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.001001.TIF\">\nSECTION B\nThe provisions of section A of this Annex shall apply to micro-organisms and animals unless another format for a unique identifier is adopted internationally and endorsed at Community level.\n",

        "groundedness_eval": "The context provides detailed information about the format of the unique identifier, including its overall structure, components, and how to calculate the verification digit. It specifies that the total format consists of nine alphanumeric characters (excluding the verification digit), divided into parts for the applicant/consent holder, transformation event, and verification digit. The section explicitly states that the overall format for the unique identifier includes nine alphanumeric digits plus a final verification digit, totaling ten characters, with a focus on the nine primary characters used to generate the verification digit. Therefore, the length of the unique identifier format specified in the Annex can be deduced from this detailed description, making the answer unambiguous.",
