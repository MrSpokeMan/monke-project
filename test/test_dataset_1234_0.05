For example, defence equipment needs to be able to operate under specific and sometimes harsh conditions, and that needs to be considered when setting ecodesign requirements. Certain information on defence equipment should not be disclosed and should be protected. Ecodesign requirements should thus not be set for products with the sole purpose of serving defence or national security. It is important that for other military or sensitive equipment ecodesign requirements take into account the security needs and the characteristics of the defence market, as defined in Directive 2009/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(22). Similarly, the space industry is strategic for Europe and for its technological non-dependence. As space technologies operate in extreme conditions, any ecodesign requirements for space products should balance sustainability considerations with resilience and expected performance.

In doing so, the Commission should take account of its experience in assessing the setting of requirements under Directive 2009/125/EC and the continuing efforts to develop and improve science-based assessment tools, including the update of the methodology for ecodesign of energy-related products, and the Product Environmental Footprint method set out in Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279(28), including as regards temporary storage of carbon, as well as the development of standards by international and European standardisation organisations, including on the material efficiency of energy-related products. Building on those tools and using dedicated studies when needed, the Commission should further reinforce circularity aspects, such as durability, repairability, including repairability scoring, recyclability, reusability, identification of chemicals hindering reuse and recycling, in the assessment of products, in accordance with a life cycle approach with a view to preparing ecodesign requirements, and should develop new methods or tools where appropriate. Information related to environmental life cycle indicators, such as the carbon footprint, should be calculated taking into consideration internationally established methods that are already implemented in Union law. It is also important to take into consideration scientific methods recommended by international and European standardisation organisations.

The Programme should also take into account the positive impact of culture on intercultural dialogue, social cohesion and the dissemination of knowledge. This requires strong European cultural and creative sectors, in particular a vibrant European audiovisual industry, given its capacity to reach diverse audiences and its economic importance, including its economic importance for other creative sectors. However, competition in global audiovisual markets has been further intensified by the deepening digital shift, for example changes in media production and consumption and the growing position of global platforms in the distribution of content. Therefore, there is a need to step up support for the European industry."

Those Directives also aim to achieve a well-functioning market place for creators and right holders, especially for press publications and online platforms, and to ensure fair remuneration of authors and performers, which are dimensions that should be taken into account across the Programme. Furthermore, support should be scaled up in order to address recent market developments, in particular the stronger position of global platforms of distribution in comparison to national broadcasters that traditionally invest in the production of European works.

This offers the potential to move to a truly circular economy in the context of the green transition while increasing the availability of critical raw materials and thereby contributing to ensure security of supply. After an initial phase of rapid growth of demand for critical raw materials for new technologies, where primary extraction and processing will still constitute the predominant source, recycling should increasingly reduce the need for primary extraction and its associated impacts. This should be done while maintaining a high level of Union recycling capacity via a strong market for secondary critical raw materials. Today, however, recycling rates of most critical raw materials are low, with waste streams such as batteries, electrical and electronic equipment and vehicles being shipped to third countries for recycling. Recycling systems and technologies are often not adapted to the specificities of those raw materials. Innovation plays an important role in reducing the need for critical raw materials, reducing the risks of shortage of supply and for the development of recycling technologies to properly and safely extract critical raw materials from waste. Prompt action addressing the different factors holding back the circularity potential is thus required."

When preparing the opinion, each committee shall use its best endeavours to reach a scientific consensus. If such a consensus cannot be reached, the opinion shall consist of the position of the majority of members and divergent positions, with the grounds on which they are based.\n8. Each committee shall establish its own rules of procedure.\nThese rules shall, in particular, lay down:\n(a) procedures for appointing and replacing the Chairman;\n(b) procedures relating to working parties and scientific advisory groups; and\n(c) a procedure for the urgent adoption of opinions, particularly in relation to the provisions of this Regulation on market surveillance and pharmacovigilance.\nThey shall enter into force after receiving a favourable opinion from the Commission and the Management Board.\n\nArticle 62\n1. Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products or the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use is required to evaluate a medicinal product, it shall appoint one of its members to act as rapporteur for the coordination of the evaluation. The Committee concerned may appoint a second member to act as co-rapporteur.\nWhen consulting the scientific advisory groups referred to in Article 56(2), the Committee shall forward to them the draft assessment report(s) drawn up by the rapporteur or the co-rapporteur. The opinion issued by the scientific advisory group shall be forwarded to the chairman of the relevant Committee in such a way as to ensure that the deadlines laid down in Article 6(3) and Article 31(3) are met.\nThe substance of the opinion shall be included in the assessment report published pursuant to Article 13(3) and Article 38(3).\nIf there is a request for re-examination of one of its opinions, the Committee concerned shall appoint a different rapporteur and, where necessary, a different co-rapporteur from those appointed for the initial opinion.

The Agency or any of the committees referred to in Article 56(1) may use the services of experts for the discharge of other specific tasks for which they are responsible.\n\nArticle 63\n1. The membership of the committees referred to in Article 56(1) shall be made public. When each appointment is published, the professional qualifications of each member shall be specified.\n2. Members of the Management Board, members of the committees, rapporteurs and experts shall not have financial or other interests in the pharmaceutical industry which could affect their impartiality. They shall undertake to act in the public interest and in an independent manner, and shall make an annual declaration of their financial interests. All indirect interests which could relate to this industry shall be entered in a register held by the Agency which is accessible to the public, on request, at the Agency's offices.\nThe Agency's code of conduct shall provide for the implementation of this Article with particular reference to the acceptance of gifts.\nMembers of the Management Board, members of the committees, rapporteurs and experts who participate in meetings or working groups of the Agency shall declare, at each meeting, any specific interests which could be considered to be prejudicial to their independence with respect to the items on the agenda. These declarations shall be made available to the public.\n\nArticle 64\n1. The Executive Director shall be appointed by the Management Board, on a proposal from the Commission, for a period of five years on the basis of a list of candidates proposed by the Commission following a call for expressions of interest published in the Official Journal of the European Union and elsewhere. Before appointment, the candidate nominated by the Management Board shall be invited forthwith to make a statement to the European Parliament and to answer any questions put by its Members. His mandate may be renewed once. The Management Board may, upon a proposal from the Commission, remove the Executive Director from his post.\n2. The Executive Director shall be the legal representative of the Agency. He shall be responsible:\n(a) for the day-to-day administration of the Agency;\n(b) for managing all the Agency resources necessary for conducting the activities of the committees referred to in Article 56(1), including making available appropriate scientific and technical support;\n(c) for ensuring that the time-limits laid down in Community legislation for the adoption of opinions by the Agency are complied with;\n(d) for ensuring appropriate coordination between the committees referred to in Article 56(1);\n(e) for the preparation of the draft statement of estimates of the Agency's revenue and expenditure, and execution of its budget;\n(f) for all staff matters;\n(g) for providing the secretariat for the Management Board.\n3.

Such a system would ensure that collections included in the register effectively apply measures restricting the supply of samples of genetic resources to third persons with documentation providing evidence of legal access, and ensure the establishment of mutually agreed terms, where required. A system of registered collections within the Union should substantially lower the risk that genetic resources which were not accessed in accordance with the national access and benefit-sharing legislation or regulatory requirements of a Party to the Nagoya Protocol are utilised in the Union. The competent authorities of Member States should verify if a collection meets the requirements for recognition as a collection for inclusion in the register.

The mere accessibility in the Union of the website or of an email address and other contact details of the data intermediation services provider, or the use of a language generally used in the third country where the data intermediation services provider is established, should be considered to be insufficient to ascertain such an intention. However, factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more Member States with the possibility of ordering services in that language, or the mentioning of users who are in the Union, could make it apparent that the data intermediation services provider is planning to offer services within the Union."

Sources are tantamount to ‘raw material’ for journalists: they are the basis for the production of media content, in particular news and current affairs content. It is therefore crucial that journalists’ ability to collect, fact-check and analyse information be protected, in particular information imparted or communicated confidentially, both offline and online, which relates to or is capable of identifying journalistic sources. Media service providers and their editorial staff, in particular journalists, including those operating in non-standard forms of employment, such as freelancers, should be able to rely on a robust protection of journalistic sources and confidential communications, including protection against undue interference and the deployment of surveillance technologies. Without such protection, the free flow of sources to media service providers could be deterred and, thus, the free exercise of the economic activity by media service providers could be hindered to the detriment of the provision of information to the public, including on matters of public interest. As a result, journalists’ freedom to exercise their economic activity and fulfil their vital ‘public watchdog’ role could be jeopardised by such obstacles, thus affecting access to quality media services negatively."

This process should ensure that the provider identifies risks or adverse impacts and implements mitigation measures for the known and reasonably foreseeable risks of AI systems to the health, safety and fundamental rights in light of their intended purpose and reasonably foreseeable misuse, including the possible risks arising from the interaction between the AI system and the environment within which it operates. The risk-management system should adopt the most appropriate risk-management measures in light of the state of the art in AI. When identifying the most appropriate risk-management measures, the provider should document and explain the choices made and, when relevant, involve experts and external stakeholders. In identifying the reasonably foreseeable misuse of high-risk AI systems, the provider should cover uses of AI systems which, while not directly covered by the intended purpose and provided for in the instruction for use may nevertheless be reasonably expected to result from readily predictable human behaviour in the context of the specific characteristics and use of a particular AI system. Any known or foreseeable circumstances related to the use of the high-risk AI system in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, which may lead to risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights should be included in the instructions for use that are provided by the provider. This is to ensure that the deployer is aware and takes them into account when using the high-risk AI system. Identifying and implementing risk mitigation measures for foreseeable misuse under this Regulation should not require specific additional training for the high-risk AI system by the provider to address foreseeable misuse. The providers however are encouraged to consider such additional training measures to mitigate reasonable foreseeable misuses as necessary and appropriate."

At the same time, this Regulations aims to avoid undermining the investment incentives for the type of connected product from which the data are obtained, for instance, by the use of data to develop a competing connected product which is considered to be interchangeable or substitutable by users, in particular on the basis of the connected product’s characteristics, its price and intended use. This Regulation provides for no prohibition on the development of a related service using data obtained under this Regulation as this would have an undesirable discouraging effect on innovation. Prohibiting the use of data accessed under this Regulation for developing a competing connected product protects data holders’ innovation efforts. Whether a connected product competes with the connected product from which the data originates depends on whether the two connected products are in competition on the same product market. This is to be determined on the basis of the established principles of Union competition law for defining the relevant product market. However, lawful purposes for the use of the data could include reverse engineering, provided that it complies with the requirements laid down in this Regulation and in Union or national law.

    "text": "Start-ups, small enterprises, enterprises that qualify as a medium-sized enterprises under Article 2 of the Annex to Recommendation 2003/361/EC and enterprises from traditional sectors with less-developed digital capabilities struggle to obtain access to relevant data. This Regulation aims to facilitate access to data for those entities, while ensuring that the corresponding obligations are as proportionate as possible to avoid overreach. At the same time, a small number of very large enterprises have emerged with considerable economic power in the digital economy through the accumulation and aggregation of vast volumes of data and the technological infrastructure for monetising them. Those very large enterprises include undertakings that provide core platform services controlling whole platform ecosystems in the digital economy and which existing or new market operators are unable to challenge or contest. Regulation (EU) 2022/1925 of the European Parliament and of the Council(26)aims to redress those inefficiencies and imbalances by allowing the Commission to designate an undertaking as a ‘gatekeeper’, and imposes a number of obligations on such gatekeepers, including a prohibition to combine certain data without consent and an obligation to ensure effective rights to data portability under Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2022/1925, and given the unrivalled ability of those undertakings to acquire data, it is not necessary to achieve the objective of this Regulation, and would therefore be disproportionate for data holders made subject to such obligations, to include gatekeeper as beneficiaries of the data access right. Such inclusion would also likely limit the benefits of this Regulation for SMEs, linked to the fairness of the distribution of data value across market actors. This means that an undertaking that provides core platform services that has been designated as a gatekeeper cannot request or be granted access to users’ data generated by the use of a connected product or related service or by a virtual assistant pursuant to this Regulation. Furthermore, third parties to whom data are made available at the request of the user may not make the data available to a gatekeeper. For instance, the third party may not subcontract the service provision to a gatekeeper. However, this does not prevent third parties from using data processing services offered by a gatekeeper. Nor does it prevent those undertakings from obtaining and using the same data through other lawful means. The access rights provided for in this Regulation contribute to a wider choice of services for consumers. As voluntary agreements between gatekeepers and data holders remain unaffected, the limitation on granting access to gatekeepers would not exclude them from the market or prevent them from offering their services."

Different categories have also achieved different levels of maturity as regards standardisation, and therefore the implementation of mechanisms for their exchange may be more or less complex depending on the category. Therefore, the improvement of interoperability and data sharing should be gradual and prioritisation of certain categories of electronic health data is needed. Categories of electronic health data such as patient summaries, electronic prescriptions and dispensations, medical imaging studies and related imaging reports, medical test results such as laboratory results and related reports, and discharge reports have been selected by the eHealth Network as most relevant for the majority of healthcare situations and should be considered as priority categories for Member States to implement access to them and their transmission. Where such priority categories of data represent groups of electronic health data, this Regulation should apply to both the groups as a whole and to the individual data entries included in those groups. For example, given that vaccination status is part of a patient summary, the rights and requirements linked to the patient summary should also apply to such vaccination status even if it is processed separately from the patient summary as a whole. When further needs for the exchange of additional categories of electronic health data are identified for healthcare purposes, access to and exchange of those additional categories should be possible under this Regulation. The additional categories should be first implemented at Member State level and the exchange on a voluntary basis of such categories of data in cross-border situations between the cooperating Member States should be provided for in this Regulation.

Third countries and international organisations could also become authorised participants in HealthData@EU, provided that they are compliant with the requirements in this Regulation. The Commission communication of 19 February 2020 entitled ‘A European strategy for data’ promoted the linking of the various common European data spaces. HealthData@EU should therefore enable the secondary use of different categories of electronic health data, including linking of the health data with data from other data spaces such as those relating to the environment, agriculture and social sector. Such interoperability between the health sector and other sectors such as the environmental, agricultural or social sectors could be relevant for obtaining additional insights on health determinants. The Commission could provide a number of services within HealthData@EU, including supporting the exchange of information amongst health data access bodies and authorised participants in HealthData@EU for the handling of cross-border access requests, maintaining catalogues of electronic health data available through the infrastructure, network discoverability and metadata queries, connectivity and compliance services. The Commission could also set up a secure processing environment, allowing data from different national infrastructures to be transmitted and analysed, at the request of the controllers.

    "text": "Online intermediation services can be crucial for the commercial success of undertakings who use such services to reach consumers. To fully exploit the benefits of the online platform economy, it is therefore important that undertakings can trust online intermediation services with which they enter into commercial relationships. This is important mainly because the growing intermediation of transactions through online intermediation services, fuelled by strong data-driven indirect network effects, leads to an increased dependence of such business users, particularly micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), on those services in order for them to reach consumers. Given that increasing dependence, the providers of those services often have superior bargaining power, which enables them to, in effect, behave unilaterally in a way that can be unfair and that can be harmful to the legitimate interests of their businesses users and, indirectly, also of consumers in the Union. For instance, they might unilaterally impose on business users practices which grossly deviate from good commercial conduct, or are contrary to good faith and fair dealing. This Regulation addresses such potential frictions in the online platform economy."

The compliance of such a procedure with Union law is to be assessed in the light of the considerations set out in the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Therefore, administrative decisions restricting or denying market access exclusively on the grounds that the goods do not have a valid prior authorisation should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation.

Instead these products intercede between the retail investor and the markets through a process of packaging or wrapping together assets so as to create different exposures, provide different product features, or achieve different cost structures as compared with a direct holding. Such packaging can allow retail investors to engage in investment strategies that would otherwise be inaccessible or impractical, but can also require additional information to be made available, in particular to enable comparisons between different ways of packaging investments."

The period during which a CCP or a trading venue could be exempted by its competent authority in respect of exchange-traded derivatives from the rules on non-discriminatory access expired on 3 July 2020. The increased uncertainty and volatility of the markets negatively impacted the operational risks of CCPs and trading venues and, therefore, the date of application of the new open-access regime for CCPs and trading venues offering trading and clearing services in respect of exchange-traded derivatives was postponed by Article 95 of Regulation (EU) 2021/23 of the European Parliament and of the Council(16)by one year, until 3 July 2021. The reasons for postponing the date of application of the new open-access regime persist. Furthermore, the open-access regime could run counter to parallel policy objectives to foster trading and innovation within the Union, since it could disincentivise innovation in exchange-traded derivatives by allowing competitors, who are beneficiaries of open access, to rely on incumbents’ infrastructure and investments in order to offer competing products with low upfront costs. Maintaining a system whereby derivatives are cleared and traded in a vertically integrated entity is also consistent with long-standing international trends.

Furthermore, the Commission evaluation concluded that the capacity ceiling, applicable since 2002 and consisting of the aggregate capacity of all the vessels that caught more than 10 tonnes of any mixture of deep-sea species in any of the years between 1998 and 2000, had no substantial positive effect. The capacity ceiling regime should therefore be updated as part of the measures to remedy the shortcomings identified in that Regulation."

    "text": "1.16 Each Contracting Government has to ensure completion of a PFSA for each of the port facilities, located within its territory, serving ships engaged on international voyages. The Contracting Government, a Designated Authority or a recognised security organisation may carry out this assessment. The completed PFSA has to be approved by the Contracting Government or the Designated Authority concerned. This approval cannot be delegated. Port facility security assessments should be periodically reviewed.\n1.17 The PFSA is fundamentally a risk analysis of all aspects of a port facility's operation in order to determine which part(s) of it are more susceptible, and/or more likely, to be the subject of attack. Security risk is a function of the threat of an attack coupled with the vulnerability of the target and the consequences of an attack.\nThe assessment must include the following components:\n- determination of the perceived threat to port installations and infrastructure;\n- identification of the potential vulnerabilities; and\n- calculation of the consequences of incidents.\nOn completion of the analysis, it will be possible to produce an overall assessment of the level of risk. The PFSA will help determine which port facilities are required to appoint a PFSO and prepare a PFSP.\n1.18 The port facilities which have to comply with the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code are required to designate a PFSO. The duties, responsibilities and training requirements of these officers and requirements for drills and exercises are defined in part A of this Code.\n1.19 The PFSP should indicate the operational and physical security measures the port facility should take to ensure that it always operates at security level 1. The plan should also indicate the additional, or intensified, security measures the port facility can take to move to and operate at security level 2 when instructed to do so. Furthermore, the plan should indicate the possible preparatory actions the port facility could take to allow prompt response to the instructions that may be issued by those responding at security level 3 to a security incident or threat thereof.\n1.20 The port facilities which have to comply with the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code are required to have, and operate in accordance with, a PFSP approved by the Contracting Government or by the Designated Authority concerned. The PFSO should implement its provisions and monitor the continuing effectiveness and relevance of the plan, including commissioning internal audits of the application of the plan. Amendments to any of the elements of an approved plan, for which the Contracting Government or the Designated Authority concerned has determined that approval is required, have to be submitted for review and approval before their incorporation into the approved plan and their implementation at the port facility. The Contracting Government or the Designated Authority concerned may test the effectiveness of the plan. The PFSA covering the port facility or on which the development of the plan has been based should be regularly reviewed. All these activities may lead to amendment of the approved plan. Any amendments to specified elements of an approved plan will have to be submitted for approval by the Contracting Government or by the Designated Authority concerned.\n1.21 Ships using port facilities may be subject to the port State control inspections and additional control measures outlined in regulation XI-2/9. The relevant authorities may request the provision of information regarding the ship, its cargo, passengers and ship's personnel prior to the ship's entry into port. There may be circumstances in which entry into port could be denied.\nInformation and communication\n1.22 Chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code require Contracting Governments to provide certain information to the International Maritime Organisation and for information to be made available to allow effective communication between Contracting Governments and between company security officers/ship security officers and the port facility security officers.\n2. DEFINITIONS\n2.1 No guidance is provided with respect to the definitions set out in chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code.\n2.2 For the purpose of this Part of the Code:.\n1 'section' means a section of part A of the Code and is indicated as 'section A/&lt; followed by the number of the section &gt;';.\n2 'paragraph' means a paragraph of this Part of the Code and is indicated as 'paragraph &lt; followed by the number of the paragraph  &gt;'; and.\n3 'Contracting Government', when used in paragraphs 14 to 18, means the 'Contracting Government within whose territory the port facility is located' and includes a reference to the Designated Authority.\n3. APPLICATION\nGeneral\n3.1 The guidance given in this Part of the Code should be taken into account when implementing the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code.\n3.2 However, it should be recognised that the extent to which the guidance on ships applies will depend on the type of ship, its cargoes and/or passengers, its trading pattern and the characteristics of the port facilities visited by the ship.\n3.3 Similarly, in relation to the guidance on port facilities, the extent to which this guidance applies will depend on the port facilities, the types of ships using the port facility, the types of cargo and/or passengers and the trading patterns of visiting ships.\n3.4 The provisions of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code are not intended to apply to port facilities designed and used primarily for military purposes.\n4. RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONTRACTING GOVERNMENTS\nSecurity of assessments and plans\n4.1 Contracting Governments should ensure that appropriate measures are in place to avoid unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, security-sensitive material relating to ship security assessments (SSAs), ship security plans (SSPs), port facility security assessments (PFSAs) and port facility security plans (PFSPs), and to individual assessments or plans.\nDesignated Authorities\n4.2 Contracting Governments may identify a Designated Authority within Government to undertake their security duties relating to port facilities as set out in chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code.\nRecognised security organisations\n4.3 Contracting Governments may authorise a recognised security organisation (RSO) to undertake certain security-related activities, including:.\n1 approval of ship security plans, or amendments thereto, on behalf of the Administration;.\n2 verification and certification of compliance of ships with the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code on behalf of the Administration; and.\n3 conducting port facility security assessments required by the Contracting Government.\n4.4 An RSO may also advise or provide assistance to Companies or port facilities on security matters, including ship security assessments, ship security plans, port facility security assessments and port facility security plans. This can include completion of a SSA or SSP or PFSA or PFSP. If an RSO has done so in respect of a SSA or SSP, that RSO should not be authorised to approve that SSP.\n4.5 When authorising an RSO, Contracting Governments should give consideration to the competency of such an organisation. An RSO should be able to demonstrate:.\n1 expertise in relevant aspects of security;.\n2 appropriate knowledge of ship and port operations, including knowledge of ship design and construction if providing services in respect of ships and of port design and construction if providing services in respect of port facilities;.\n3 their capability to assess the likely security risks that could occur during ship and port facility operations, including the ship/port interface, and how to minimise such risks;.\n4 their ability to maintain and improve the expertise of their personnel;.\n5 their ability to monitor the continuing trustworthiness of their personnel;.\n6 their ability to maintain appropriate measures to avoid unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, security-sensitive material;.\n7 their knowledge of the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code and relevant national and international legislation and security requirements;.\n8 their knowledge of current security threats and patterns;.\n9 their knowledge of recognition and detection of weapons, dangerous substances and devices;.\n10 their knowledge of recognition, on a non-discriminatory basis, of characteristics and behavioural patterns of persons who are likely to threaten security;.\n11 their knowledge of techniques used to circumvent security measures; and.\n12 their knowledge of security and surveillance equipment and systems and their operational limitations.\nWhen delegating specific duties to a RSO, Contracting Governments, including Administrations, should ensure that the RSO has the competencies needed to undertake the task.\n4.6 A recognised organisation, as referred to in regulation I/6 and fulfilling the requirements of regulation XI-1/1, may be appointed as a RSO provided it has the appropriate security-related expertise listed in paragraph 4.5.\n4.7 A port or harbour Authority or port facility operator may be appointed as a RSO provided it has the appropriate security-related expertise listed in paragraph 4.5.\nSetting the security level\n4.8 In setting the security level, Contracting Governments should take account of general and specific threat information. Contracting Governments should set the security level applying to ships or port facilities at one of three levels:\n- Security level 1, normal; the level at which the ship or port facility normally operates;\n- Security level 2, heightened; the level applying for as long as there is a heightened risk of a security incident; and\n- Security level 3, exceptional; the level applying for the period of time when there is the probable or imminent risk of a security incident."

    "text": "16.5 Contracting Governments should approve the PFSPs of the port facilities under their jurisdiction. Contracting Governments should develop procedures to assess the continuing effectiveness of each PFSP and may require amendment of the PFSP prior to its initial approval or subsequent to its approval. The PFSP should make provision for the retention of records of security incidents and threats, reviews, audits, training, drills and exercises as evidence of compliance with those requirements.\n16.6 The security measures included in the PFSP should be in place within a reasonable period of the PFSP's approval and the PFSP should establish when each measure will be in place. If there is likely to be any delay in their provision, this should be discussed with the Contracting Government responsible for approval of the PFSP and satisfactory alternative temporary security measures that provide an equivalent level of security should be agreed to cover any interim period.\n16.7 The use of firearms on or near ships and in port facilities may pose particular and significant safety risks, in particular in connection with certain dangerous or hazardous substances, and should be considered very carefully. In the event that a Contracting Government decides that it is necessary to use armed personnel in these areas, that Contracting Government should ensure that these personnel are duly authorised and trained in the use of their weapons and that they are aware of the specific risks to safety that are present in these areas. If a Contracting Government authorises the use of firearms they should issue specific safety guidelines on their use. The PFSP should contain specific guidance on this matter, in particular with regard its application to ships carrying dangerous goods or hazardous substances.\nOrganisation and performance of port facility security duties\n16.8 In addition to the guidance given under paragraph 16.3, the PFSP should establish the following, which relate to all security levels:.\n1 the role and structure of the port facility security organisation;.\n2 the duties, responsibilities and training requirements of all port facility personnel with a security role and the performance measures needed to allow their individual effectiveness to be assessed;.\n3 the port facility security organisation's links with other national or local authorities with security responsibilities;.\n4 the communication systems provided to allow effective and continuous communication between port facility security personnel, ships in port and, when appropriate, with national or local authorities with security responsibilities;.\n5 the procedures or safeguards necessary to allow such continuous communications to be maintained at all times;.\n6 the procedures and practices to protect security-sensitive information held in paper or electronic format;.\n7 the procedures to assess the continuing effectiveness of security measures, procedures and equipment, including identification of, and response to, equipment failure or malfunction;.\n8 the procedures to allow the submission, and assessment, of reports relating to possible breaches of security or security concerns;.\n9 procedures relating to cargo handling;.\n10 procedures covering the delivery of ship's stores;.\n11 the procedures to maintain, and update, records of dangerous goods and hazardous substances and their location within the port facility;.\n12 the means of alerting and obtaining the services of waterside patrols and specialist search teams, including bomb searches and underwater searches;.\n13 the procedures for assisting ship security officers in confirming the identity of those seeking to board the ship when requested; and.\n14 the procedures for facilitating shore leave for ship's personnel or personnel changes, as well as access of visitors to the ship, including representatives of seafarers' welfare and labour organisations.\n16.9 The remainder of section 16 addresses specifically the security measures that could be taken at each security level covering:.\n1 access to the port facility;.\n2 restricted areas within the port facility;.\n3 handling of cargo;.\n4 delivery of ship's stores;.\n5 handling unaccompanied baggage; and.\n6 monitoring the security of the port facility.\nAccess to the port facility\n16.10 The PFSP should establish the security measures covering all means of access to the port facility identified in the PFSA.\n16.11 For each of these the PFSP should identify the appropriate locations where access restrictions or prohibitions should be applied for each of the security levels. For each security level the PFSP should specify the type of restriction or prohibition to be applied and the means of enforcing them.\n16.12 The PFSP should establish for each security level the means of identification required to allow access to the port facility and for individuals to remain within the port facility without challenge. This may involve developing an appropriate identification system, allowing for permanent and temporary identifications, for port facility personnel and for visitors respectively. Any port facility identification system should, when it is practicable to do so, be coordinated with that applying to ships that regularly use the port facility. Passengers should be able to prove their identity by boarding passes, tickets, etc., but should not be permitted access to restricted areas unless supervised. The PFSP should establish provisions to ensure that the identification systems are regularly updated, and that abuse of procedures should be subject to disciplinary action.\n16.13 Those unwilling or unable to establish their identity and/or to confirm the purpose of their visit when requested to do so should be denied access to the port facility and their attempt to obtain access should be reported to the PFSO and to the national or local authorities with security responsibilities.\n16.14 The PFSP should identify the locations where persons, personal effects, and vehicle searches are to be undertaken. Such locations should be covered to facilitate continuous operation, regardless of prevailing weather conditions, in accordance with the frequency laid down in the PFSP. Once subjected to search, persons, personal effects and vehicles should proceed directly to the restricted holding, embarkation or car loading areas.\n16.15 The PFSP should establish separate locations for checked and unchecked persons and their effects and if possible separate areas for embarking/disembarking passengers, ship's personnel and their effects to ensure that unchecked persons are not able to come in contact with checked persons.\n16.16 The PFSP should establish the frequency of application of any access controls, particularly if they are to be applied on a random, or occasional, basis.\nSecurity level 1\n16.17 At security level 1, the PFSP should establish the control points where the following security measures may be applied:.\n1 restricted areas, which should be bounded by fencing or other barriers to a standard which should be approved by the Contracting Government;.\n2 checking identity of all persons seeking entry to the port facility in connection with a ship, including passengers, ship's personnel and visitors, and confirming their reasons for doing so by checking, for example, joining instructions, passenger tickets, boarding passes, work orders, etc.;.\n3 checking vehicles used by those seeking entry to the port facility in connection with a ship;.\n4 verification of the identity of port facility personnel and those employed within the port facility and their vehicles;.\n5 restricting access to exclude those not employed by the port facility or working within it, if they are unable to establish their identity;.\n6 undertaking searches of persons, personal effects, vehicles and their contents; and.\n7 identification of any access points not in regular use, which should be permanently closed and locked.\n16.18 At security level 1, all those seeking access to the port facility should be liable to search. The frequency of such searches, including random searches, should be specified in the approved PFSP and should be specifically approved by the Contracting Government. Unless there are clear security grounds for doing so, members of the ship's personnel should not be required to search their colleagues or their personal effects. Any such search shall be undertaken in a manner which fully takes into account the human rights of the individual and preserves their basic human dignity.\nSecurity level 2\n16.19 At security level 2, the PFSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied, which may include:.\n1 assigning additional personnel to guard access points and patrol perimeter barriers;.\n2 limiting the number of access points to the port facility, and identifying those to be closed and the means of adequately securing them;.\n3 providing for means of impeding movement through the remaining access points, e.g. security barriers;.\n4 increasing the frequency of searches of persons, personal effects, and vehicles;.\n5 denying access to visitors who are unable to provide a verifiable justification for seeking access to the port facility; and.\n6 using patrol vessels to enhance water-side security.\nSecurity level 3\n16.20 At security level 3, the port facility should comply with instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The PFSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the port facility, in close cooperation with those responding and the ships at the port facility, which may include:.\n1 suspension of access to all, or part, of the port facility;.\n2 granting access only to those responding to the security incident or threat thereof;.\n3 suspension of pedestrian or vehicular movement within all, or part, of the port facility;.\n4 increased security patrols within the port facility, if appropriate;."

Furthermore, even if other factors may have also played a role in the aggravated state of the Union industry, thus also affecting to some extent the profitability development of the Union industry, by no means can this mitigate the impact of the dumped imports from the PRC constantly undercutting the Union prices, particularly given that this occurred at a relatively stable rate despite the changes in the market such as consumption growth and fall or raw material price developments."

It is recalled that farmed salmon production in the Community is effectively limited by government licences specifying the maximum amount of live fish, which may be held in the water at any place at any point in time. Thus, the above capacity figures reflect a theoretical capacity based on the total quantity licensed rather than the physical fish-holding capacity of the cages or other production material operated by the Community industry.

    "text": "(116) In a worst case scenario with the imposition of measures, the cost of users’ raw material will be set at the level of the MIP, namely at the level of the actual costs incurred by producers plus reasonable profit for deliveries on the Community market. Although this scenario does not reflect current market conditions, it is considered that in such a case it cannot be excluded that the imposition of anti-dumping duties will have some negative impact on importers and processors as duties, if any, would be directly payable at the time of import whatever the level of the import price. However, in this context it is recalled that the measure proposed is in the form of a MIP which is a floor price intended only to ensure that Community producers can sell their salmon in the Community at prices, on the basis of the lesser duty rule, that will allow them to cover their costs and allow for a margin of profit that they could normally expect in the absence of dumped imports. Duties will only be collected, in possible exceptional cases, when the free-at-Community-frontier price of Norwegian imports falls below the MIP and then only at a level equivalent to the difference between the import price and the MIP. In addition, the whole salmon market from production to deliveries to consumers will be governed by fair competition. These conditions will allow for costs to be duly reflected on the sales prices at each level of the distribution chain. Users may also expect an increased possibility of supplies from EU sources and from other third countries, once the market will be recovering from the effects of injurious dumping. Indeed, when all operators in the market enjoy sound market conditions governed by fair trade, the largest choices of products and qualities are available from various sources of supply. Prices being set according to market signals should have a positive impact on the production and distribution chains, allowing more price and cost stability and predictability."

The market, however, will not sustain this situation for a long time. Salmon prices to users will be below the costs of producers for deliveries on the Community market. If dumping is allowed to recur, Norwegian imports representing around 60 % of Community consumption will prevent exports from non-dumped third country sources. Users will not have the choice of obtaining alternative supplies and quality. The fact that prices will not be set according to market signals will lead to price volatility and negative influence on final products to consumers.

Further, given the magnitude of the margins between the whole fish ex-farm and the retail price of processed salmon products, it is considered that the measures are unlikely to have a material effect on retail prices, since it is unlikely that the full price increase, if any, will be passed on to consumers. Indeed, at current market prices which are well above the MIP, there would be no impact at all. The impact on consumers, even in a worst case scenario, is therefore likely to be small. In addition, loss-making price levels are probably not sustainable in the medium to long term. On that basis, it is not expected that anti-dumping measures would have any significant negative consequences for consumers."

The period under consideration started on 1 April 2004 whereas the use of calendar years would have meant starting this period on 1 January 2004. According to the data presented by the company, this change in the starting point would show a 12 % increase in Chinese export prices between the calendar year 2004 and IP in contrast to the slight decrease reported in recital 50 of the provisional Regulation. However, it should be noted that data presented by the importer was based on its total purchasing prices which obviously covered only part of the Chinese exports to the Community. Having examined the data with regard to the average prices of all imports of MSG from the PRC, based on Eurostat, it was found that the relevant Chinese prices increased by only 0,5 % from January 2004 to the end of the IP and not by 12 % as claimed by the importer. The difference in price trends between that found for the period considered (a decrease of 2 %) and that found for the period from January 2004 to the end of the IP (an increase of 0,5 %) is not such as to alter the conclusions drawn in regard to the effect of these prices on the situation of the Community industry.

    "text": "(38) Certain interested parties questioned the analysis of the trends of the injury indicators. They claimed that the use of 12-month periods running in line with the complainant’s financial year rather than calendar years effectively shortened the period under consideration to three years as the financial year 2007 is, to a big extent, overlapping with the IP. These parties claimed that in order to make a proper appraisal of the trends of the injury indicators, the period considered should be prolonged to cover the full calendar year 2004. In this regard, it should be pointed out that the basic Regulation does not provide for a strict timeline regarding the definition of the period considered. Furthermore, the WTO Recommendation concerning the periods of data collection for anti-dumping investigations provides that ‘As a general rule, […] the period of data collection for injury investigations normally should be at least three years […]’(4). Nevertheless, a comparative analysis of the basic injury indicators on a calendar year basis was made, i.e. assuming a period considered of 2004, 2005, 2006 and the IP, in order to verify if different conclusions would be drawn as regards injury. This analysis has shown that the trends of the main injury indicators do not change significantly. Although certain trends such as the decreases in production and sales volumes would be less pronounced as compared to the conclusions in the provisional Regulation, other findings relating to the negative profitability of the Community industry, the huge increase of imports from the PRC and the severe price undercutting would remain unchanged. Furthermore, it should be noted that the period considered serves as an indicator of the evolution of the Community industry’s situation to determine whether it can be considered to be suffering material injury during the IP. In these circumstances, the argument of the parties is rejected on the ground that the injury picture would have continued to show material injury even if the period considered was extended by the first trimester of 2004."

During the period under consideration this import level fluctuated but by the IP returned to the same level of the Community consumption. The average import price in the IP was EUR 735 per tonne in comparison with EUR 586 for 2004. Bearing in mind that the exact type of these imports was not known, it was difficult to perform price comparisons. Nevertheless, it appears that the prices from other third countries are much higher than those of the cumulated countries and the other countries concerned. This would suggest that imports from other third countries are (at most) undercutting the Community industry prices to a lesser degree than dumped imports, or that they would not undercut at all. It can not therefore be concluded that they contribute substantially to the injury suffered by the Community industry or that they break the causal link."

The rationale for this calculation is that a duty calculated in this way would, if applied to the company’s sales during the IP, result in zero underselling, i.e. a non-injurious price.

Moreover, significant price variations were also found for sales prices of the Community industry during the period considered. Therefore, the product is not suitable for a fixed price undertaking. The company proposed that the minimum price should be indexed on the basis of the price development of a raw material, namely wire rod. However in the absence of publicly available price information for the raw material used in the product concerned and in view of the opposite price trend of a comparable raw material, namely wire rod mesh quality, no correlation could be established between the sales prices of the finished product in the community and the main raw material.

However, when comparing the imports on model by models basis it has been found that not only there is a substantial matching between the imports of the PRC and Vietnamese bicycles with those produced by the sampled Community producers, but that there is also a substantial matching between the models imported from the PRC and those imported from Vietnam. It was also claimed that the market segments, in which the Vietnamese exporters were selling their bicycles, were different from those served by the PRC exporters and the Community producers, thereby justifying a different price. This allegation was however not supported by any evidence. Moreover, it appears that in certain Member States, where Vietnamese imports have an important market share, bicycles from Vietnam are present in the various market segments.

    "text": "Article 5\nInitiation and subsequent conduct of proceedings\n1. Where, after consultation of the interested Member States, there appears to be sufficient evidence to warrant initiating proceedings, the Commission shall immediately:\n(a) announce the initiation of proceedings by publishing a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities; such notice shall state the product and Member States concerned, summarize the evidence, and invite interested parties to submit relevant infor mation to the Commission; they shall state the period within which interested parties may make written representations and apply to be heard orally by the Commission in accordance with paragraph 5;\n(b) so advise interested Member States, the complainants and the exporters and importers known to the Commission to be concerned;\n(c) commence an investigation at Community level, acting in cooperation with the Member States; the investigation shall cover both the alleged dumping and the resultant injury and shall be carried out in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 8; the investigation of dumping shall normally cover a period of not less than six months immediately prior to the initiation of proceedings.\n2. The Commission shall seek all information it deems necessary and may, where it considers it appropriate to do so, examine and check the records of importers, exporters, traders, agents, producers, and trade associations and organizations.\n3. (a) The Commission may request Member States:\n- to supply information,\n- to carry out all necessary checks and inspections, particularly on importers, traders and producers,\n- to afford the necessary assistance to the officials authorized by the Commission to enable them to make their investigation.\n(b) Member States shall take whatever steps are necessary to comply with requests from the Commission. They shall supply the Commission with the information requested and with the results of any inspections, checks or investigations carried out.\n(c) Where the information is of general interest or where its circulation has been requested by a Member State, the Commission shall circulate the information to the interested Member States, except where it is confidential, in which case a non-confidential summary shall be circulated.\n(d) Officials of the Commission shall be authorized, if the Commission or a Member State so requests, to assist the officials of Member States in carrying out their duties under this paragraph.\n4. (a) The complainant, the importers and exporters known to be concerned and the representatives of the exporting Member State may inspect all evidence supplied to the Commission by any party to the investigation (as opposed to internal documents prepared by the authorities of the Community or its Member States), provided that it is relevant to the defence of their interests, not confidential as defined in Article 6 and being used by the Commission in the investigation. Requests to see such evidence shall be made in writing to the Commission specifying the evidence concerned.\n(b) Exporters and importers of the product under investigation may request to be told the essential facts and grounds on which it is intended to authorize the injured Member State or States to impose anti-dumping duties.\n(c) (i) Requests for information pursuant to (b) shall:\n(aa) be made to the Commission in writing;\n(bb) specify the particular matters on which information is sought;\n(cc) be received, in cases where a recommendation has been issued to the party or parties found to be responsible for dumping, not later than one month after publication of the recommendation.\n(ii) the information may be given orally or in writing, as the Commission considers appropriate. Its disclosure shall be without prejudice to any subsequent recommendations or authorizations contemplated by the Commission. Confidential information shall be treated in accordance with Article 6.\n(iii) The information shall normally be given no later than 15 days before the Commission authorizes the injured Member State or States to impose anti-dumping duties. Representations made after the information is given shall be taken into consideration only if received within a period to be set by the Commission in each case depending on the urgency, but being not less than 10 days.\n5. The Commission may hear interested parties orally. It shall do so if they request such a hearing in writing within the period prescribed in the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, showing that they are an interested party likely to be affected by the outcome of the proceedings and that there are particular reasons why they should be heard orally. 6. Furthermore the Commission shall, on request, give the parties directly concerned an opportunity to meet, so that opposing views may be presented and rebuttal arguments put forward. In providing this opportunity, the Commission shall take account of the need to preserve confidentiality and of the convenience of the parties. There shall be no obligation on any party to attend a meeting and failure to do so shall not be prejudicial to that party's case.\n7. Anti-dumping proceedings shall not constitute a bar to customs clearance of the product concerned.\n8. A proceeding shall be concluded either when it appears at the end of the investigation that it is not necessary to take measures, or when, as a result of a Commission recommendation, the enterprise undertakes to terminate dumping or by the Commission's authorizing the injured Member State or Member States to impose anti-dumping duties as provided for in Article 10.\n\nArticle 6\nConfidentiality\n1. Information acquired pursuant to this Regulation shall be used only for the purpose of the relevant investigation.\n2. (a) The Commission and the Member States, and their respective officials, shall not disclose any information received pursuant to this Regulation for which confidentiality has been requested by the supplier of the information, without specific permission from the supplier.\n(b) Requests for confidentiality shall indicate why the information is confidential and shall be accompanied by a non-confidential summary of the information, unless the supplier furnishes good reasons why the information is not susceptible of such summary.\n3. Information will ordinarily be considered to be confidential if its disclosure is likely to have a significantly adverse effect upon the supplier or the source of the information.\n4. However, if it appears that a request for confidentiality is not warranted and if the supplier is unwilling to make the information public or to authorize its disclosure in generalized or summary form, the information in question may be disregarded.\nThe information may also be disregarded where such request is warranted, but the supplier is unwilling to provide a non-confidential summary although the information is susceptible of such summary.\n5. This Article shall not preclude the disclosure by the Commission of general information, and in particular of the grounds on which recommendations or authorizations under Articles 8 and 9 are based, or of such evidence as is necessary to justify its action in court proceedings. Such disclosure must take into account the legitimate interest of the parties in the preservation of their trade secrets.\n\nArticle 7\nClosure of proceedings where no protective measures are necessary\n1. If it becomes apparent, after consultations of the interested Member States, that no protective measures are necessary, the proceedings shall be closed.\n2. The Commission shall announce the closure of proceedings by publishing a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities summarizing its findings and the gounds on which they are based.\n\nArticle 8\nRecommendations and undertakings\n1. Where the facts indicate that there was dumping during the period covered by the investigation, and injury, the Commission may address to the party or parties who were the originators of the dumping recommendations that dumping be terminated, within the period it lays down, by means of a measure which eliminates the dumping margin or puts an end to the injury resulting therefrom.\n2. The party or parties who are the originators of the dumping shall communicate, to the Commission, their undertakings to this effect before expiry of the period laid down.\n3. Before addressing its recommendations to the enterprises, the Commission shall consult with the Member States concerned.\n4. The Commission may require any party from whom an undertaking has been accepted to provide periodically information relevant to the fulfilment of the undertaking, and to permit verification of pertinent data. Non-compliance with such requirements shall be construed as a violation of the undertakings.\n5. Where an undertaking has been withdrawn or the Commission has reason to believe that it has been violated, the Commission may, where the Community interest calls for such action, after consultations of the interested Member States and after having offered the exporter concerned an opportunity to comment, authorize the imposition of anti-dumping duties on the basis of the facts established before acceptance of the undertaking. Article 9\nProtective measures\nWhere the originator or originators of the dumping fail to comply with the recommendations of the Commission or fail to give an undertaking to this end within the period laid down, or fail to comply with such undertaking, the Commission shall authorize the injured Member State or Member States to introduce anti-dumping duties and shall define the conditions and procedures for such duties after consultation of the interested Member States.\n"

    "text": "(d) transactions not included in the three groups above: consumption of fixed capital and acquisitions less disposals of non-produced non financial assets (12).\nProperties of transactions\nInteractions versus intra-unit transactions\n1.34. Most transactions are interactions between two or more institutional units. However, the system records some actions within institutional units as transactions. The purpose of recording these intra-unit transactions is to give a more analytically useful picture of output, final uses and costs.\nConsumption of fixed capital, which is recorded as a cost by the system, is an important intra-unit transaction. Most of the other intra-unit transactions are transactions in products, typically recorded when institutional units operating as both producers and final consumers choose to consume some of the output they have produced themselves. This is often the case for households and general government.\n1.35. All own-produced output used for final uses within the same institutional unit is recorded. Own-produced output used for intermediate consumption within the same institutional unit is recorded only when production and intermediate consumption take place in different local kind-of-activity units within the same institutional unit. Output produced and used as intermediate consumption within the same local kind-of-activity unit is not recorded.\nMonetary versus non-monetary transactions\n1.36. Most transactions recorded by the system are monetary transactions, where the units involved make or receive payments, or incur liabilities or receive assets denominated in units of currency.\nTransactions that do not involve the exchange of cash, or assets or liabilities denominated in units of currency, are non-monetary transactions. Intra-unit transactions are normally non-monetary transactions. Non-monetary transactions involving more than one institutional unit occur among transactions in products (barter of products), distributive transactions (remuneration in kind, transfers in kind, etc.) and other transactions (barter of non-produced non-financial assets).\nThe system records all transactions in monetary terms. The values to be recorded for non-monetary transactions must therefore be measured indirectly or otherwise estimated.\nTransactions with and without counterparts\n1.37. Transactions involving more than one unit are either 'something for something` or 'something for nothing` transactions. The former are exchanges between institutional units, i.e. provision of goods, services or assets in return for a counterpart, e.g. money. The latter typically are payments in cash or in kind from one institutional unit to another without counterpart. 'Something for something` transactions occur in all four transaction groups, while 'something for nothing` transactions occur mainly among distributive transactions, in the form of, for example, taxes, social assistance benefits or gifts.\nRearranged transactions\n1.38. The system's treatment of most transactions is straightforward; that is, the transactions are recorded in the same way as they appear to the institutional units involved. However, some transactions are rearranged in order to bring out the underlying economic relationships more clearly. Transactions can be rearranged in three ways: rerouting, partitioning and recognizing the principal party to a transaction.\nRerouting\n1.39. A transaction that appears to the units involved as taking place directly between units A and C may be recorded as taking place indirectly through a third unit B. Thus, the single transaction between A and C is recorded as two transactions: one between A and B, and one between B and C. In this case the transaction is rerouted.\nAs well-known example of a rerouting is employers' social contributions paid directly by employers to social insurance funds. The system records these payments as two transactions: employers pay employer's social contributions to their employees, and employees pay the same contributions to social insurance funds. As with all reroutings, the purpose of rerouting employers' social contributions is to bring out the economic substance behind the transaction. In this case this means to show employer's social contributions as contributions paid for the benefit of employees.\nAnother type of rerouting is that of transactions recorded as taking place between two or more institutional units, although according to the parties involved no transaction takes place at all. An example is the treatment of property income earned on certain insurance funds, which is retained by insurance enterprises. The system records this property income as being paid by insurance enterprises to policy holders, who then pay the same amount back to the insurance enterprises as premium supplements.\nPartitioning\n1.40. When a transaction appearing to the parties involved as a single transaction is recorded as two or more differently classified transactions, the transaction is partitioned. Partitioning does usually not imply involving additional units in the transactions.\nThe payment of non-life insurance premiums is a typical partitioned transaction. Although policy holders and insurers regard these payments as one transaction, the system divides them into two quite different transactions: payments in return for non-life insurance services provided, and net non-life insurance premiums. The recording of trade margins is another important case of partitioning.\nRecognizing the principal party to a transaction\n1.41. When a unit carries out a transaction on behalf of another unit, the transaction is recorded exclusively in the accounts of the principal. As a rule, one should not go beyond this principle and try, for instance, to allocate taxes or subsidies to ultimate payers or ultimate beneficiaries under the adoption of assumptions.\nBorderline cases\n1.42. The definition of a transaction stipulates that an interaction between institutional units be by mutual agreement. When a transaction is undertaken by mutual agreement, the prior knowledge and consent of the institutional units is implied. However, this does not mean that all units necessarily enter a transaction voluntarily, because some transactions are imposed by law. This applies mainly to certain distributive transactions, such as payments of taxes, fines and penalties. However, uncompensated seizure of assets is not regarded as a transaction, even when imposed by law.\nIllegal economic actions are transactions only when all units involved enter the actions voluntarily. Thus, purchases, sales or barters of illegal drugs or stolen property are transactions, while theft is not.\nOther changes in assets\n1.43. Other changes in assets record changes that are not the result of transactions (13). They are either:\n(a) other changes in the volume of assets and liabilities; or\n(b) holding gains and losses.\nOther changes in the volume of assets and liabilities\n1.44. These changes can be roughly divided into three main categories:\n(a) normal appearance and disappearance of assets other than by transactions;\n(b) changes in assets and liabilities due to exceptional, unanticipated events;\n(c) changes in classification and structure.\n1.45. Examples of changes within category (a) are discovery or depletion of subsoil assets, and natural growth of non-cultivated biological resources. Category (b) comprises changes (normally losses) in assets due to natural disasters, war or severe acts of crime (14). Unilateral cancellation of debt and uncompensated seizure of assets also belong to category (b). Category (c) consists of changes as a consequence of reclassification and restructuring of institutional units or of assets and liabilities.\nHolding gains and losses\n1.46. Holding gains and losses result from changes in the prices of assets. They occur on all kinds of financial and non-financial assets, and on liabilities. Holding gains and losses accrue to the owners of assets and liabilities purely as a result of holding the assets or liabilities over time, without transforming them in any way.\nHolding gains and losses measured on the basis of current market prices are called nominal holding gains and losses. These may be decomposed into neutral holding gains and losses, reflecting changes in the general price level, and real holding gains and losses, reflecting changes in the relative prices of assets.\nStocks\n1.47. Stocks are holdings of assets and liabilities at a point in time. Stocks are recorded at the beginning and end of each accounting period. The accounts that show stocks are called balance sheets (15).\nStocks are also recorded for population and employment. However, these stocks are recorded as mean values over the accounting period.\nStocks are recorded for all assets within the system's boundaries; that is, for financial assets and liabilities and for non-financial assets, both produced and non-produced. However, the coverage is limited to those assets that are used in economic activity and that are subject to ownership rights. Thus, stocks are not recorded for assets such as human capital and natural resources that are not owned.\nWithin its boundaries, the system is exhaustive in respect of both flows and stocks. This implies that all changes in stocks can be fully explained by recorded flows.\nTHE SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTS AND THE AGGREGATES (16)\nRules of accounting\n1.48. An account is a means of recording, for a given aspect of economic life, the uses and resources or the changes in assets and the changes in liabilities during the accounting period, or the stock of assets and liabilities existing at the beginning or at the end of this period.\nTerminology for the two sides of the accounts"

    "text": "2.07. The term centre of economic interest indicates the fact there exists some location within the economic territory on, or from, which a unit engages, and intends to continue to engage, in economic activities and transactions on a significant scale, either indefinitely or over a finite but long period of time (a year or more). It follows that a unit which carries out such transactions on the economic territory of several countries is deemed to have a centre of economic interest in each of them. The ownership of land and buildings within the economic territory is deemed to be sufficient in itself for the owner to have a centre of economic interest there.\n2.08. On the basis of these definitions, units deemed to be residents of a country can be sub-divided into:\n(a) units which are principally engaged in production, finance, insurance or redistribution, in respect of all their transactions except those relating to ownership of land and buildings;\n(b) units which are principally engaged in consumption (23), in respect of all their transactions except those relating to ownership of land and buildings;\n(c) all units in their capacity as owners of land and buildings with the exception of owners of extraterritorial enclaves which are part of the economic territory of other countries or are States sui generis (see paragraph 2.06.).\n2.09. In the case of units which are principally engaged in production, finance, insurance or redistribution, in respect of all their transactions except those relating to ownership of land and buildings, the following two cases may be distinguished:\n(a) activity conducted exclusively on the economic territory of the country: units which carry out such activity are resident units of the country;\n(b) activity conducted for a year or more on the economic territories of several countries: only that part of the unit which has a centre of economic interest on the economic territory of the country is deemed to be a resident unit. It may be:\n1. either an institutional resident unit (see paragraph 2.12.), whose activities conducted for a year or more in the rest of the world are excluded and treated separately (24) or\n2. a notional resident unit (see paragraph 2.15.), in respect of the activity conducted in the country for a year or more by a unit which is resident in another country (25).\n2.10. In the case of units which are principally engaged in consumption, except in their capacity as owners of land and buildings, households which have a centre of economic interest in the country are deemed to be resident units, even if they go abroad for short periods (less than a year). They include, in particular, the following:\n(a) border workers, i.e. people who cross the frontier daily to work in a neighbouring country;\n(b) seasonal workers, i.e. people who leave the country for several months, but less than a year, to work in another country in sectors in which additional manpower is needed periodically;\n(c) tourists, patients, students (26), visiting officials, businessmen, salesmen, artists and crew members who travel abroad;\n(d) locally recruited staff working in the extraterritorial enclaves of foreign governments;\n(e) the staff of the institutions of the European Union and of civilian or military international organizations which have their headquarters in extraterritorial enclaves;\n(f) the official, civilian or military representatives of the government of the country (including their households) established in territorial enclaves.\n2.11. All units in their capacity as owners of land and/or buildings which form part of the economic territory are deemed to be resident units or notional resident units (see paragraph 2.15.) of the country in which the land or buildings in question are located.\nTHE INSTITUTIONAL UNITS\n2.12. Definition: The institutional unit is an elementary economic decision-making centre characterized by uniformity of behaviour and decision-making autonomy in the exercise of its principal function. A resident unit is regarded as constituting an institutional unit if it has decision-making autonomy in respect of its principal function and either keeps a complete set of accounts or it would be possible and meaningful, from both an economic and legal viewpoint, to compile a complete set of accounts if they were required.\nIn order to be said to have autonomy of decision in respect of its principal function, a unit must:\n(a) be entitled to own goods or assets in its own right; it will therefore be able to exchange the ownership of goods or assets in transactions with other institutional units;\n(b) be able to take economic decisions and engage in economic activities for which it is itself held to be directly responsible and accountable at law;\n(c) be able to incur liabilites on its own behalf, to take on other obligations or further commitments and to enter into contracts.\nIn order to be said to keep a complete set of accounts, a unit must keep accounting records covering all its economic and financial transactions carried out during the accounting period, as well as a balance sheet of assets and liabilities.\n2.13. The following principles apply whenever entities do not clearly possess both the characteristics of an institutional unit:\n(a) households always enjoy autonomy of decision in respect of their principal function and must therefore be institutional units, even though they do not keep a complete set of accounts;\n(b) entities which do not keep a complete set of accounts, and for which it would not be possible or meaningful to compile a complete set of accounts if required, are combined with the institutional units into whose accounts their partial accounts are integrated;\n(c) entities which, while keeping a complete set of accounts, have no autonomy of decision in the exercise of their principal function are combined with the units which control them;\n(d) entities which satisfy the definition of an institutional unit are treated as such even if they do not publish their accounts;\n(e) entities forming part of a group of units engaged in production and keeping a complete set of accounts are deemed to be institutional units even if they have partially surrendered their autonomy of decision to the central body (the holding corporation) responsible for the general direction of the group; the holding corporation itself is deemed to be an institutional unit distinct from the units which it controls, unless (b) is applicable;\n(f) quasi-corporations keep a complete set of accounts and have no independent legal status. However, they have an economic and financial behaviour that is different from that of their owners and similar to that of corporations. Therefore they are deemed to have autonomy of decision and are considered as distinct institutional units.\n2.14. Holding corporations are institutional units whose main function is to control and direct a group of subsidiaries.\n2.15. Notional resident units are defined as:\n(a) those parts of non-resident units which have a centre of economic interest (that is in most cases which engage in economic transactions for a year or more or which carry out a construction activity for a period of less than a year if the output constitutes gross fixed capital formation) on the economic territory of the country;\n(b) non-resident units in their capacity as owners of land or buildings on the economic territory of the country, but only in respect of transactions affecting such land or buildings.\nNotional resident units, even if they keep only partial accounts and may not always enjoy autonomy of decision, are treated as institutional units.\n2.16. In conclusion, the following are deemed to be institutional units:\n(a) units which have a complete set of accounts and autonomy of decision:\n1. private and public corporations;\n2. cooperatives or partnerships recognized as independent legal entities;\n3. public producers which by virtue of special legislation are recognized as independent legal entities;\n4. non-profit institutions recognized as independent legal entities;\n5. agencies of general government;\n(b) units which have a complete set of accounts and which are deemed to have autonomy of decision: quasi-corporations (see paragraph 2.13. f);\n(c) units which do not necessarily keep a complete set of accounts, but which by convention are deemed to have autonomy of decision:\n1. households;\n2. notional resident units (see paragraph 2.15.).\nTHE INSTITUTIONAL SECTORS\n2.17. The need for aggregation means that it is impossible to consider individual institutional units separately; they must be combined into groups called institutional sectors or simply sectors, some of which are divided into subsectors.\n>TABLE>\n2.18. Each of the sectors and subsectors groups together the institutional units which have a similar type of economic behaviour.\nThe institutional units are grouped into sectors on the basis of the type of producer they are and depending on their principal activity and function, which are considered to be indicative of their economic behaviour.\nA sector is divided into subsectors according to the criteria relevant to that sector; this permits a more precise description of the economic behaviour of the units.\nThe accounts for sectors and subsectors record all the activities, whether principal or secondary, of the institutional units covered.\nEach institutional unit belongs to only one sector or subsector.\n2.19. When the principal function of the institutional unit is to produce goods and services, it is necessary in deciding the sector to which it should be allocated - to distinguish first of all the type of producer it is belonging to.\nThree types of producers are distinguished in the ESA:\n(a) private and public market producers (see paragraph 3.24 and table 3.1 of chapter 3);\n(b) private producers for own final use (see paragraph 3.25 and table 3.1 of chapter 3);"

    "text": "5.121. Category F.7 includes transactions in financial claims which stem from the early or late payment for transactions in goods or services, distributive transactions or secondary trade in financial assets. They consist of the counterpart transactions in case payment is due and not yet paid. Debts arising from income accruing over time and arrears are also classified under this category.\n5.122. Category F.7 does not include:\n(a) statistical discrepancies other than timing differences between transactions in goods and services, distributive transactions or financial transactions and the corresponding payments;\n(b) items about which there is not enough information for them to be classified. The classification should be based on whatever information is available;\n(c) items about whose nature nothing whatsoever is known;\n(d) the miscellaneous item of the balance of payments described as net errors and omissions;\n(e) early or late payment (inclusive of arrears) in case of the creation of financial assets or the redemption of liabilities other than classified in category F.7. They remain classified in their category.\n5.123. Category F.7 is divided into two sub-categories of financial transactions:\n(a) trade credits and advances (F.71);\n(b) other accounts receivable/payable, excluding trade credits and advances (F.79).\nTrade credits and advances (F.71)\n5.124. Definition: The sub-category trade credits and advances (F.71) consists of all transactions in trade credits and advances (AF.71) that is financial claims arising from the direct extension of credit by suppliers and buyers for goods and services transactions and advance payments for work that is in progress or to be undertaken and associated with such transactions.\n5.125. Sub-category AF.71 includes:\n(a) financial claims relating to the delivery of goods or services where payment has not taken place;\n(b) trade credit accepted by factoring corporations except when regarded as a loan;\n(c) rent of buildings accruing over time;\n(d) arrears concerning the payment of goods and services, when not evidenced by a loan.\n5.126. Sub-category AF.71 does not include loans to finance trade credits. They are classified in category AF.4 (see paragraph 5.81. h).\n5.127. Trade credits and advances may be financial assets or liabilities of all sectors and the rest of the world.\nOther accounts receivable/payable, excluding trade credits and advances (F.79)\n5.128. Definition: The sub-category other accounts receivable/payable excluding trade credits and advances (F.79) consists of all transactions in other accounts receivable/payable excluding trade credits and advances (AF.79) that is financial claims which arise from timing differences between distributive transactions or financial transactions on the secondary market and the corresponding payment. It includes also financial claims due to income accruing over time.\n5.129. Sub-category AF.79 includes financial claims created as a result of the timing difference between accrued transactions and payments made in respect of, for example:\n(a) taxes;\n(b) social contributions;\n(c) wages and salaries;\n(d) rents on land and subsoil assets;\n(e) dividends;\n(f) interest;\n(g) transactions in financial assets on the secondary market.\n5.130. Preferably, the counterpart financial transaction of interest accruing on financial assets (see paragraph 5.17) should be recorded as being reinvested in that financial asset. The recording of interest will, however, have to follow national practices. If the interest accrual is not recorded as being reinvested in the financial asset, it should be classified in sub-category F.79.\n5.131. At the date due for payment of interest, two financial transactions are recorded (see paragraph 5.17): firstly, in the event of payment, a transaction in the financial asset used for payment, or, in the event of non-payment, an increase of interest arrears to be recorded in sub-category F.79; secondly, the counterpart financial transaction reducing the net financial claim of the creditor against the debtor.\nMEMORANDUM ITEM: DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT (F.m)\n5.132. Definition: Direct foreign investment (F.m) consists of all transactions in direct foreign investment (AF.m) that is investment involving a long-term relationship reflecting a lasting interest of a resident institutional unit in one economy ('direct investor`) in an institutional unit resident in an economy other than that of the investor ('direct investment enterprise`). The direct investor's purpose is to exert a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise resident in the other economy. Direct investment involves both the initial transaction between the direct investor and the direct investment enterprise and all subsequent capital transactions between them and among affiliated enterprises, both incorporated and unincorporated (75).\n5.133. Transactions in financial assets and liabilities that constitute direct foreign investment are to be recorded under the appropriate categories of financial transactions, i.e. loans (F.4), shares and other equity (F.5) and other accounts receivable/payable (F.7). However, the amounts of direct foreign investment included within each of those categories should also be recorded separately as a memorandum item.\nACCOUNTING RULES FOR FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS\nVALUATION\n5.134. Financial transactions are recorded at the transaction values, that is, the values in national currency at which the financial assets and/or liabilities involved are created, liquidated, exchanged or assumed between institutional units, or between them and the rest of the world, on the basis of commercial considerations only.\n5.135. Financial transactions and their financial or non-financial counterpart transactions are recorded at the same transaction value. Three possibilities can be envisaged:\n(a) the financial transaction is a transaction in means of payment in national currency (see paragraphs 5.04 and 5.23): the transaction value is equal to the amount of the means of payment exchanged;\n(b) the financial transaction is a transaction in means of payment in foreign currency (see paragraphs 5.04 and 5.23) and the counterpart transaction is not a transaction in means of payment in national currency: the transaction value is equal to the amount of the means of payment exchanged converted into national currency applying the market rate prevailing when the payment takes place;\n(c) neither the financial transaction nor its counterpart transaction is a transaction in means of payment (see paragraph 5.04): the transaction value is identified with the current market value of the financial assets and/or liabilities involved.\n5.136. The transaction value refers to a specific financial transaction and its counterpart transaction. In concept, the transaction value is to be clearly distinguished from a value based on a price quoted in the market, a fair market price, or any price that is intended to express the generality of prices for a class of similar or even identical financial assets and/or liabilities. However, in cases where the counterpart transaction of a financial transaction is, for example, a transfer and therefore the financial transaction is undertaken other than for purely commercial considerations, the transaction value is identified with the current market value of the financial assets and/or liabilities involved.\n5.137. The transaction value does not include service charges, fees, commissions, and similar payments for services provided in carrying out the transactions; these are to be recorded as payments for services. Taxes on financial transactions are also excluded and treated as taxes on services within taxes on products. When a financial transaction involves a new issue of liabilities, the transaction value is equal to the amount of the liability incurred exclusive of any prepaid interest. Similarly, when a liability is extinguished, the transaction value for both creditor and debtor must correspond to the reduction of the liability.\nSpecial valuation criteria for some sub-categories of financial transactions\n5.138. Securities other than shares, excluding financial derivatives (F.33)\n(a) When securities are marketed by issuers through underwriters or other intermediaries and then sold at higher prices to final investors, the financial assets and liabilities are to be recorded at the values paid by the investors. The differences between the amounts paid by the investors and those received by the issuers should be treated as service payments paid by the issuers to the underwriters.\n(b) Security issues are recorded at the issue value. When securities are issued at a discount or at a premium, the proceeds to the issuer at the time of sale, and not the face value, are recorded in the accounts as the actual issue value. The difference between the issue value and the redemption value is treated as interest that is accrued over the life of the security.\n(c) Deep-discount or zero-coupon bonds should be treated as securities issued at a discount. The interest is accrued over the life of the bonds and treated as being reinvested in such bonds (see paragraph 4.46).\n(d) When long-term securities are issued at a discount, which is not significant, the difference between the issue value and the redemption value can be imputed at the date of issue.\n(e) In case of securities where the value of the principal is linked to a price index, the price of a commodity or an exchange rate index, the issue price of the security is recorded as the principal and the index payment paid periodically and/or at maturity is treated as interest that is accrued over the life of the security, and the counterpart is recorded as reinvestment in securities other than shares in the financial account.\n(f) Investment in securities in circulation on the secondary market is recorded at the stock exchange quotation or market price."

    "text": "Labour incomes as presented in this table can be decomposed into a volume and a price component by labour type and industry: full-time equivalent employment and (weighted, full-time equivalent) wage rates, respectively. Apart from that, a fully-fledged SAM also contains a table showing the allocation of these labour incomes and the concomitant employment to household groups. Similar transactions might be shown for imputed labour income of the self-employed.\nA data set which contains an estimate of imputed labour income of the self-employed person units as well as a split of all labour income into a volume and a price component yields detailed labour data which are quite useful for all kinds of analysis and which are directly linked to all important macro-economic aggregates, including employment (that is, the total number of employed person units) and full-time equivalent employment (that is, total labour input volume).\n>TABLE>\nTable 8.21 - Example of a more detailed social accounting matrix\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\nTable 8.22 - Example of a detailed submatrix: net value added (basic prices)\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\nCHAPTER 9\nINPUT-OUTPUT FRAMEWORK\n9.01. The input-output framework consists of three types of tables:\n(a) supply and use tables;\n(b) tables linking the supply and use tables to the sector accounts;\n(c) symmetric input-output tables.\n9.02. Supply and use tables are matrices by industry and product describing the domestic production processes and the transactions in products of the national economy in great detail. These tables show:\n(a) the structure of the costs of production and the income generated in the production process;\n(b) the flows of goods and services produced within the national economy;\n(c) the flows of goods and services with the rest of the world.\n9.03. A supply table shows the supply of goods and services by product and by type of supplier, distinguishing output by domestic industries and imports. A simplified example of a supply table is given in table 9.1.\nTable 9.1 - A simplified supply table\n>START OF GRAPHIC>\nSupplies\nIndustries\nRest of the World\nTotal\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nProducts\n(1)\nOutput by product and by industry\nImports by product\nTotal supply by product\nTotal\n(2)\nTotal output by industry\nTotal imports\nTotal supply\n>END OF GRAPHIC>\n9.04. A use table shows the use of goods and services by product and by type of use, i.e. as intermediate consumption (by industry), final consumption, gross capital formation or exports. Furthermore, the table shows the components of gross value added, i.e. compensation of employees, other taxes less subsidies on production, net mixed income, net operating surplus and consumption of fixed capital. A simplified example of a use table is given in table 9.2.\nTable 9.2 - A simplified use table\n>START OF GRAPHIC>\nUses\nIndustries\nROW\nFinal consumption\nGross capital formation\nTotal\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\nProducts\n(1)\nIntermediate consumption by product and by industry\nExports\nFinal consumption expenditure\nGross capital formation\nTotal use by product\nComponents of value added\n(2)\nValue added by component and by industry\nTotal\n(3)\nTotal inputs by industry\n>END OF GRAPHIC>\n9.05. Between the supply and use tables, two types of identities hold good (provided supplies and uses are valued consistently, see tables 9.5 and 9.6):\n(a) the identity by industry: Output by industry = Input by industry. In terms of our simplified supply and use table, this indicates that the row vector in cell (2,1) in table 9.1 should be equal to that in cell (3,1) in table 9.2.\nSo, for each industry:\nOutput = Intermediate consumption + Value added;\n(b) the identity by product: Total supply by product = Total use by product.\nIn terms of our simplified tables, the column vector in cell (1,3) of table 9.1 should be equal to the column vector in cell (1,5) of table 9.2.\nSo, for each product:\nOutput + Imports = Intermediate consumption + Exports + Final consumption expenditure + Gross capital formation.\nThese identities by industry and product can be used to check and improve the consistency and completeness of estimates (see paragraph 9.11).\n9.06. Supply and use tables are the central framework for all tables by industry, e.g. those on employment, gross fixed capital formation and capital stock.\n9.07. The supply and use tables contain all the flows in the following accounts:\n(a) the goods and services account;\n(b) the production account;\n(c) the generation of income account.\n9.08. A supply table and a use table can also be combined and presented as a single table. This can be achieved by adding two rows and a column to the table, for output and imports (see table 9.3). Note that the rows and columns from the supply table presented in paragraph 9.03 have been transposed here.\nTable 9.3 - A simplified combined supply and use table\n>START OF GRAPHIC>\nProducts\nIndustries\nROW\nFinal consumption\nGross capital formation\nTotal\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\nProducts\n(1)\n-\nIntermediate consumption\nExports\nFinal consumption expenditure\nGross capital formation\nTotal use by product\nIndustries\n(2)\nOutput\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal output by industry\nComponents of value added\n(3)\n-\nValue added\nROW\n(4)\nImports\n-\nTotal\n(5)\nTotal supply by product\nTotal inputs by industry\n>END OF GRAPHIC>\n9.09. A symmetric input-output table is a product by product or industry by industry matrix describing the domestic production processes and the transactions in products of the national economy in great detail. A symmetric input-output table rearranges both supply and use in a single table. There is one major conceptual difference between a symmetric input-output table and a combined supply and use table: in the supply and use table, the statistics relate products to industries, while in the symmetric input-output table the statistics relate products to products or industries to industries. So, in a symmetric input-output table either a product or an industry classification is employed for both rows and columns (see table 9.4).\nTable 9.4 - A simplified symmetric input-output table (product by product)\n>START OF GRAPHIC>\nProducts\nROW\nFinal consumption expenditure\nGross capital formation\nTotal\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\nProducts\n(1)\nIntermediate consumption\nExports\nFinal consumption expenditure\nGross capital formation\nTotal use by product\nComponents of value added\n(2)\nValue added\n-\n-\n-\n-\nROW\n(3)\nImports\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal\n(3)\nTotal supply by product\n-\n-\n-\nTotal supply = Total use\n>END OF GRAPHIC>\n9.10. Most statistical information that can be obtained from producer units indicates what type of products they have produced/sold and, usually less detailed, what type of products they have bought/used. The format of the supply and use tables is designed to fit in with this type of statistical information (i.e. industry by product). By contrast, information of a product by product or industry by industry nature as required by the symmetric input-output table is not often available. For example, surveys of industries usually provide information about the type of products used and about the products produced. However, information on the inputs in terms of products and value added components for each product produced is usually not collectable. Ideally, the administration of an enterprise should show all costs allocated to the various types of output and, simultaneously, show the composition of intermediate consumption by type of product. In practice, information arranged in the form of supply and use tables is therefore a practical starting point for constructing the more analytic information in the symmetric input-output tables. The industry by product information in the supply and use tables can be converted into product by product or industry by industry statistics by adding extra statistical information on the input structures, or by assuming constant input structures by product or by industry (see paragraphs 9.54-9.60).\n9.11. The supply and use tables serve both statistical and analytical purposes.\nImportant statistical purposes are:\n(a) identifying gaps and inconsistencies in basic data sources;\n(b) weighting and calculation of index numbers and price and volume measures;\n(c) making estimates by residual (estimating a variable by first estimating all other variables in the identity), e.g. for the production or final consumption of specific products;\n(d) checking and improving the consistency, plausibility and completeness of figures in the supply and use tables and the derived figures (such as those in the production accounts). To this end, the balancing process should not be limited to the supply and use tables at current prices:\n1. by compiling supply and use tables at current and constant prices for two or more years, estimates of changes in volumes, values and prices can be balanced simultaneously: compared to integrating supply and use tables for a single year in isolation, this is a major extension of the effectiveness of the integration framework;\n2. with the aid of the tables showing the linkage with the sector accounts, a direct comparison can be made with information from the latter, e.g. information on the distribution of income, on saving and on net lending (calculated as the result of financial transactions). This at least guarantees that, after the balancing process, consistency is obtained between the supply and use tables and the sector accounts;\n3. trying to derive symmetric input-output tables from the supply and use tables may reveal inconsistencies and weaknesses in the supply and use tables. In this respect, there is therefore also a feedback from the symmetric input-output tables to the supply and use tables;\n(e) estimating figures for periods on which less reliable information is available, e.g. estimating annual figures on the basis of the detailed supply and use figures for a benchmark year or estimating quarterly figures on the basis of annual supply and use tables."

    "text": "10.03. The general rule for comparisons in space is that accurate measures must be made for both the volume and the price components of the economic aggregates. As the spread between the Laspeyres and Paasche formulae is often significant in spatial comparisons, the Fisher index formula is the only acceptable one for this purpose.\n10.04. The economic accounts have the advantage of providing a suitable framework for constructing a system of volume and price indices as well as ensuring the consistency of the statistical data.\nThe advantages of an accounting approach can be summarized as follows:\n(a) on a conceptual level, the use of an accounting framework covering the entire economic system requires the prices and physical units for the different products and flows in the system to be specified consistently. In a framework of this type it is imperative that, for example, the price and volume concepts for a given group of products should be defined identically in both resources and uses;\n(b) on a statistical level, the use of the economic accounts framework imposes accounting constraints which must be respected at both current and constant prices and will normally require some adjustments to be made to ensure consistency of the price and volume data;\n(c) furthermore, the creation of an integrated system of price and volume indices in the context of a system of economic accounts provides the national accountant with extra checks. Assuming the existence of a balanced system of supply and use tables at current prices, the construction of such balanced tables at constant prices means that a system of implicit price indices can be automatically derived. Examination of the plausibility of these derived indices can lead to revision and correction of the data at constant prices and even, in some cases, of the values at current prices;\n(d) finally, the accounting approach permits the measurement of price and volume changes for certain balancing items in the accounts, the latter being derived by definition from the other elements in the accounts.\n10.05. Despite the advantages of an integrated system based on the balance, both overall and by industry, of transactions in goods and services, it has to be acknowledged that the price and volume indices thus obtained do not meet all needs or answer all possible questions on the subject of change in prices or volume. Accounting constraints and the choice of price and volume index formulae, although essential for the construction of a coherent system, can sometimes be a hindrance. There is also a need for information for shorter periods such as months or quarters. In these cases, other forms of price and volume indices may prove useful.\nSCOPE OF PRICE AND VOLUME INDICES IN THE ACCOUNTS SYSTEM\n10.06. Among the flows which appear in economic accounts at current prices, there are some (mainly concerning products) where the distinction between changes in price and volume is similar to that made at microeconomic level. For many other flows in the system, the distinction is far less obvious.\nIn the former case, the flows cover a group of elementary transactions in goods and services, the value of each being equivalent to the product of a number of physical units and their respective unit price. In this case it is sufficient to know the breakdown of the flow in question into elementary transactions in order to determine its average variation in price and volume.\nIn the latter case, which concerns a number of transactions relating to distribution and financial intermediation as well as to balancing items such as value-added, it is difficult or even impossible to separate directly current values into price and volume components and special solutions have to be adopted.\nThere is also a need to measure the real purchasing power of a number of aggregates, such as compensation of employees, disposable income of households or national income. This can be done, for example, by deflating them by means of an index of the prices of the goods and services which can be bought with them.\n10.07. It must be emphasized that the objective and the procedure followed when measuring the real purchasing power are fundamentally different from those followed when deflating goods and services and balancing items. For these an integrated system of price and volume indices can be established, which is useful, among other things, for measuring economic growth. The valuation in real terms of flows of the last type uses price indices of flows other than those considered, which may differ according to the objectives of the analysis: it can only be a convention and cannot be done in a unique way within an integrated system of price and volume indices.\nTHE INTEGRATED SYSTEM OF PRICE AND VOLUME INDICES\n10.08. The systematic division of changes in current values into the components 'changes in price` and 'changes in volume` is restricted to flows representing transactions, recorded in the goods and services accounts (0) and in the production accounts (I); it is carried out both for the data relating to individual industries and for those relating to the total economy. Flows representing balancing items, for example value added, cannot be directly factored into price and volume components; this can only be done indirectly using the relevant flows of transactions.\nThe use of the accounting framework imposes a double constraint on the calculation of the data:\n(a) the balance of the goods and services account must for any sequence of two years be obtained at both constant and current prices;\n(b) each flow at the level of the total economy must be equal to the sum of the corresponding flows for the various industries.\nA third constraint, not inherent in the use of an accounting framework but resulting from a deliberate choice, is that every change in the value of transactions must be attributed either to a change in price or to a change in volume, or to a combination of the two.\nIf these three requirements are fulfilled, valuation of the goods and services accounts and production accounts at constant prices means that an integrated set of price and volume indices can be obtained.\n10.09. The items to be considered when constructing such an integrated set are as follows:\n>TABLE>\nPRICE AND VOLUME INDICES FOR OTHER AGGREGATES\n10.10. In addition to the price and volume measures considered above, the following aggregates can also be decomposed into their own price and volume components. The objectives for these measures vary.\n>TABLE>\nInventories at the beginning and at the end respectively of each period may have to be calculated at constant prices in order to estimate the volume change in inventories during the period.\nThe stock of produced fixed assets has to be calculated at constant prices to estimate capital output ratios, as well as to obtain a basis for estimating consumption of fixed capital at constant prices.\nCompensation of employees has to be calculated at constant prices for purposes of measuring productivity and in some instances also when outputs have been estimated by using constant price data on inputs.\n10.11. Compensation of employees is an element of income. For the purpose of measuring purchasing power it can be valued in real terms by deflating with an index reflecting the prices of products purchased by employees. Other income elements too, such as disposable income of households and national income, can be measured in real terms in the same general way.\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MEASURING PRICE AND VOLUME INDICES\nDEFINITION OF PRICES AND VOLUMES OF MARKET PRODUCTS\n10.12. The creation of an integrated system of price and volume indices is based on the assumption that, at the level of a single homogeneous good or service, value (v) is equal to the price per unit of quantity (p), multiplied by the number of quantity units (q), that is\nv &equiv; p × q\n10.13. Definition: Price is defined as the value of one unit of a product, for which the quantities are perfectly homogeneous not only in a physical sense but also in respect of a number of other characteristics described in paragraph 10.16. To be additive in an economic sense, quantities must be identical and have the same unit price. For each aggregate of transactions in goods and services shown in the accounts, price and quantity measures have to be constructed so that\nvalue index = price index × volume index\nThis means that each and every change in the value of a given flow must be attributed either to a price change or to a change in volume or to a combination of the two.\n10.14. For transactions in goods it is in many cases easy to define the physical unit involved in the transaction and hence the price per unit. In a number of cases, for example for unique capital goods, it is more difficult and special solutions have to be adopted.\nFor transactions in services it is frequently more difficult to specify the characteristics which determine the physical units and differences of opinion on the criteria to be used may arise. This may concern important industries such as financial intermediation services, wholesale and retail trade, services to enterprises, education, research and development, health or recreation. In view of the growing importance of the service industries, it is essential to find common solutions to the problem of the choice of physical units, even if they are only conventional ones.\nDIFFERENCES IN QUALITY AND DIFFERENCES IN PRICE\n10.15. The physical and other characteristics to be taken into consideration when identifying products constitute differences in quality and play an important role, while at the same time raising difficult statistical problems.\nThe fact is that for many goods and services intended for a specific purpose there exist several varieties of differing qualities, each with its own price.\n10.16. Differences in quality are reflected by the following factors:\n(a) physical characteristics;\n(b) deliveries in different locations;"

    "text": "10.69. If the economies of the two countries differ much from one another, the spread between these two indices may be quite large and the results would depend too much on which one is chosen. For binary comparisons the ESA therefore requires an average between the two, in the form of a Fisher index.\n10.70. Direct quantitative comparisons between economic situations that have little in common with each other are inherently difficult and the method of deflation of current values with price indices is therefore the best alternative. This applies even more in international than in intertemporal comparisons. By careful specification and identification of products, price relatives can be calculated from information collected in price surveys in each country. As prices are quoted in national currencies, the interpretation of the price relatives introduces the concept of purchasing power parity (PPP). For a given product the PPP between two currencies of countries A and B is defined as the number of units of country B's currency that are needed in country B to purchase the same quantity of the product as one unit of country A's currency will purchase in country A. PPPs for groups of products and successively higher levels of aggregation up to GDP are obtained by weighting PPPs for products by their share in expenditure. In order to arrive at a price level index between the two countries, the PPP index has to be divided by the current exchange rate between the two currencies concerned.\n10.71. For non-market services, international comparisons face the same problem as intertemporal comparisons. This means that outputs are measured as the sum of inputs. The method used at present in interspatial comparisons is to obtain PPPs on the basis of price relatives for important elements in these inputs. This method, which implies volume comparisons of inputs, fails to take into account differences in productivity in non-market service production in the countries compared. It is important, therefore, to develop methods which instead lead to comparisons of the volume of output of non-market services. This should in principle be feasible for individual non-market services, in the same general way as when intertemporal comparisons are concerned.\n10.72. The need to make international comparisons of prices and volumes between countries is recognized in the ESA. The main objective is volume comparisons of GDP and its uses and the condition of transitivity must be met. Transitivity means that the direct index for country C based on country A is equal to the indirect index obtained by multiplying the direct index for country B based on country A by the direct index for country C based on country B.\n10.73. The approach adopted in the ESA to the calculation of a set of multilateral volume measures and PPPs is to start from binary comparisons between all possible pairs of countries considered. The Fisher indices used for this purpose are not transitive, but it is possible to derive from them a set of transitive indices that resemble the original Fisher indices as closely as possible, using the traditional criterion of least squares for this purpose. Minimising the deviations between the original Fisher indices and the desired transitive indices leads to the so-called EKS formula.\n10.74. The EKS index utilizes all the indirect indices linking country i to country k as well as the direct index between them. Between countries i and k it is the geometric mean of the direct index between i and k and every possible indirect index connecting countries i and k. The direct index is given twice the weight of each indirect index. Transitivity is achieved by involving every other country in the EKS index for any given pair of countries.\nCHAPTER 11\nPOPULATION AND LABOUR INPUTS\n11.01. Certain comparisons between countries, or between industries or sectors within the same economy, become meaningful only when the aggregates in the national accounts (for example, gross domestic product, the final consumption of households, the value-added of an industry, compensation of employees) are considered in relation to the number of inhabitants and labour input variables. It is therefore necessary to have definitions of the total population, employment, jobs, total hours worked, full-time equivalence and employee labour input at constant compensation, which are closely linked to the concepts used in the national accounts.\n11.02. These titles are defined in the system on the basis of the concepts of economic territory and centre of interest.\n11.03. Labour inputs must be classified on the basis of the same statistical units as used for the analysis of production, namely the local kind-of-activity unit and the institutional unit.\n11.04. The aggregates to which the figures for population and labour inputs are related are annual totals. Therefore, average population and labour inputs during the year should be used.\nWhen inquiries are conducted at several times during the course of the year, the figure taken is the average of the results obtained on these various dates.\nWhen a single inquiry is made, is is important to examine if the period used is fully representative; the last available information on variations throughout the year should be used in estimating data for the year as a whole. For example, when estimating the mean employment, some allowance should be made for the fact that certain people do not work throughout the whole year (casual and/or seasonal workers).\nTOTAL POPULATION\n11.05. Definition: On a given date, the total population of a country consists of all persons, national or foreign, who are permanently settled in the economic territory of the country, even if they are temporarily absent from it. For some purposes, an annual average of head counts will provide an appropriate basis for estimating national accounts variables or for use as a denominator in comparisons.\n11.06. Total population is defined for national accounts according to the concept of residence (see units and grouping of units chapter).\nA person who is staying, or intends to stay, on the economic territory of the country for a period of one year or more is regarded as permanently settled there.\nA person is regarded as being temporarily absent if he or she is permanently settled in the country but is staying, or intends to stay, in the rest of the world for a period of less than one year.\nAll individuals who belong to the same household (92) are resident where the household has a centre of economic interest: this is where the household maintains a dwelling, or succession of dwellings, which members of the household treat, and use, as their principal residence. A member of a resident household continues to be a resident even if that individual makes frequent journeys outside the economic territory because its centre of economic interest remains in the economy in which the household is resident.\n11.07. The total population of a country includes:\n(a) nationals settled in the country;\n(b) national civilians who are staying abroad for a period of less than one year (frontier workers, seasonal workers, tourists, patients, etc.);\n(c) foreign civilians settled in the country for a period of one year or more (including the personnel (93) of the institutions of the European Communities and of international civilian organizations located within the geographic territory of the country);\n(d) foreign military personnel (94) working with international military organizations located within the geographic territory of the country;\n(e) foreign technical assistance personel (95) on long-term assignments who work in the country and are deemed to be employed by their host government on behalf of the government, or international organization, which is actually financing their work.\nBy convention, the total population also includes the following, irrespective of the length of their stay outside the country:\n(a) national students however long they study abroad;\n(b) members (96) of the country's armed forces stationed in the rest of the world;\n(c) nationals (97) who are on the staff of national scientific bases established outside the geographic territory of the country;\n(d) nationals (98) who are on the staff of diplomatic missions abroad;\n(e) nationals (99) who are members of the crews of fishing boats, other ships, aircraft and floating platforms operating partly, or wholly, outside the economic territory.\n11.08. Conversely, the total population of a country does not include:\n(a) foreign civilians staying on the territory for less than a year (frontier workers, seasonal workers, tourists, patients, etc.);\n(b) national civilians staying abroad for a period of one year or more;\n(c) national military personnel working with international organizations located in the rest of the world;\n(d) national technical assistance personnel on long-term assignments who work abroad and are deemed to be employed by their host government on behalf of the government, or international organization, which is actually financing their work.\nand also, by convention:\n(a) foreign students however long they study in the country;\n(b) members of the armed forces of a foreign country who are stationed in the country;\n(c) the foreign personnel of foreign scientific bases located on the geographic territory of the country;\n(d) members of foreign diplomatic missions stationed in the country.\n11.09. The definition given above differs from the present (or de facto) population, which consists of persons actually present on the geographic territory of a country at a given date.\nECONOMICALLY ACTIVE POPULATION"

Transactions involving the ownership (gross fixed capital formation) and use (renting, insurance, etc.) of this type of equipment are attributed to the economy of the country of which the owner and/or operator respectively are resident. In cases of financial leasing a change of ownership is assumed.\n(22) The territories used by the institutions of the European Union and international organizations thus constitute the territories of States sui generis. The feature of such States is that the only residents are the institutions themselves (see paragraph 2.10. e).\n(23) Consumption is not the only possible activity of households. Households may as entrepreneurs engage in any kind of economic activity.\n(24) It is only where such activity is carried on for less than a year that it should not be separated from the activities of the producer institutional unit. This may also be done where the activity, though conducted for a year or more, is insignificant, and in all circumstances for the installation of equipment abroad. But a unit which is resident in another country and which is carrying out a construction activity in the country for a duration of less than a year is deemed to have a centre of economic interest on the economic territory of the country if the output of the construction activity constitutes gross fixed capital formation. Such a unit should therefore be treated as a notional resident unit.\n(25) Students are always treated as residents, however long they study abroad.\n(26) By convention, market regulatory agencies whose sole or principal activity is to buy, hold and sell agricultural and other food products are classified under S.11 (see paragraph 2.69 (a) note (11)).\n(27) Including institutions financed by voluntary contributions of a quasi-fiscal nature, levied on producers by units whose principal activity is to provide services in exchange. These contributions are considered as purchases of market services.\n(28) By convention, sector S.12 includes holding corporations which only control and direct a group of subsidiaries principally engaged in financial intermediation and/or in auxiliary financial activities (see paragraph 2.43) and non-profit institutions recognized as independent legal entities serving financial corporations (see paragraph 2.44).\n(29) The classification of holding corporations within the financial corporations sector deviates from the 1993 SNA 4.100 in order to maintain consistency with the monetary financial institutions for statistical purposes as defined by the EMI and with official statistics on insurance corporations.\n(30) This is a deviation from the 1993 SNA 4.86 and 4.101 in order to maintain consistency with the monetary financial institutions for statistical purposes as defined by the EMI.\n(31) By convention, market regulatory organizations which are either exclusively or principally simple distributors of subsidies are classified in S.13, subsector central government S.1311. However, those organizations which are exclusively or principally engaged in buying, holding and selling agricultural or food products are classified in S.11 (see paragraph 2.21, note 6).\n(32) NPIs controlled and mainly financed by general government are classified in the general government sector (see paragraph 2.69 b).\n(33) Included are the institutions of the EU and international organizations (see also paragraph 2.06).\n(34) NACE Rev. 1: Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community in accordance with the Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 of 9 October 1990.\n(35) The local KAU is called establishment in the SNA and ISIC Rev. 3.\n(36) Services for own final use concern only housing services produced by owner-occupiers and domestic services produced by employing paid staff (see paragraph 3.21).\n(37) Services for own final use concern only housing services produced by owner-occupiers and domestic services produced by employing paid staff (see paragraph 3.21).\n(38) CPA: Classification of Products by Activity in accordance with the Council Regulation (EEC) No 3696/93 of 29 October 1993.\n(39) Though these revenues may not be sufficient to cover 50 % of all the costs of the museum shop, e.g. because that also includes compensation of employees of the museum shop personnel.\n(40) For the trade and transport margins included, see also table 3.5, third column in second part of the table.\n(41) Employers' imputed social contributions include an amount equal in value to the wages and salaries which employers temporarily continue to pay in the event of the sickness, maternity, industrial injury, disability, redundancy, etc. of their employees, if that amount can be separated.\n(42) Subsidies are granted by the institutions of the European Union to units resident anywhere in the Community.\n(43) However, when a grant serves the dual purpose of financing both the amortization of the debt and the payment of interest on it, and when it is not possible to apportion it between the two elements, the whole of the grant is treated as an investment grant.\n(44) This practice differs from that of most business accounting, where interest paid is normally shown as a fixed charge similar to other costs of production in the operating account.\n(45) The borderline between taxes and purchases of services from government is defined according to the same criteria as those used in the case of payments made by enterprises: if the licences are being granted automatically on payment of the amounts due, their payment is treated as taxes. But if the government uses the issue of licences to organize some proper regulatory function (such as checking the competence, or qualifications, of the person concerned), the payments made should be treatead as purchases of services from government rather than payments of taxes, unless the payments are clearly out of all proportion to the cost of providing the services.\n(46) The borderline between taxes and purchases of services from government is defined according to the same criteria as those used in the case of payments made by enterprises: if the licences are being granted automatically on payment of the amounts due, their payment is treated as taxes.

They are divided into: (a) premiums constituting a form of social contribution (they are paid to social insurance schemes); (b) individual life insurance premiums. The former are included under the heading actual social contributions and the latter are not treated as distributive transactions. Both categories of life insurance premiums increase the insurance technical reserves which appear in the financial account and in the balance sheet.\n(49) Life insurance claims do not appear as such in the system of accounts. They are divided into: (a) claims constituting a form of social benefits; (b) individual life insurance claims. The former are included under the heading social benefits other than social transfers in kind and the latter are not treated as distributive transactions. Both categories of life insurance claims reduce the insurance technical reserves which appear in the financial account, and in the balance sheet.\n(50) Current transfers within general government are flows internal to the general government sector, and do not appear in a consolidated account for the sector as a whole.\n(51) International organisations, in the sense used in the system, derive their authority either directly from the national States which are their members or indirectly from them through other international organisations whose members are national States.\n(52) The levies paid by resident producer units to the Institutions of the European Union are recorded in the accounts as taxes on production paid to the rest of the world; GNP based fourth own resource created by the Council Decision of 24 June 1988 on the system of the Communities' own resources is classified in D.75 Miscellaneous current transfers.\n(53) The current transfers which the Institutions of the European Union make directly to resident market producer units are shown as subsidies paid by the rest of the world."

The primary criterion for the choice of the basis on which to establish the gas prices is that it reasonably reflects a price normally payable in undistorted markets. It is undisputed that this condition is met with respect to the prices at Waidhaus. Secondly, the fact that the volume of gas sold at non-regulated prices in the domestic market was only minor during the RIP and that such prices were significantly closer to the regulated domestic price than to the freely-determined export price strongly suggests that these non-regulated prices were distorted by the prevailing regulated prices. Therefore, the unregulated domestic prices could not be used. It was also considered that Russian export prices of gas to the Baltic States were not sufficiently representative, due to the relatively low export volumes to these countries. Furthermore, necessary data concerning transportation and distribution cost were not available and therefore, reliable prices to the Baltic States could not be established. Indeed, by far the greatest volume of gas is exported via the Waidhaus hub which represents therefore an appropriate basis for an adjustment. The applicant did not provide any evidence regarding the existence of representative markets, other than the Waidhaus hub, where prices reasonably reflect a price normally payable in undistorted markets.

The labelling requirements also cover information necessary for the protection of human health and the environment when using EU fertilising products, such as information necessary for the correct application of Council Directive 91/676/EEC(4)and information necessary for the correct handling and use of such products after purchase, for example information on storage conditions."

In this context and with regard to other rules specific to products made available in packaging, packaging should contain no more than 1 000 kg in line with Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011(5)in order to ensure that larger quantities, typically used in industrial settings, are treated differently from packages normally provided to consumers. Products supplied in packaging exceeding this limit should be considered to be supplied without packaging for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2019/1009. That will also address the challenges that vulnerable groups could face. The specific information that economic operators should be allowed to provide only on a digital label should therefore reflect the current state of the digitalisation of the society and the particular situation of the users of EU fertilising products and should acknowledge the diversity of the user base. In order to enable all end-users to make informed choices before buying EU fertilising products and to ensure the safe handling and use of such products by all groups of end-users, labelling information concerning safety and the protection of human, animal, plant health and the environment, as well as minimum information on the agronomic efficiency of the EU fertilising products and on their content and correct use, should always be provided on the physical label. Digital labels could also include information on greenhouse gas emissions related to the production process, the environmental impact of the fertiliser, including its production process and the agroecological efficiency.

PAHs are also present in some products used as binders in clay targets (also known as clay pigeons). Clay targets are flying (saucer-shaped) targets used by sports shooters and small game hunters to practice. They are produced using binders such as coal tar pitch, high temperature (‘CTPHT’), petroleum pitch or other types of resins. At least 270 tonnes of PAHs per year are estimated to be released to the environment during the production and use of PAHs-containing clay targets. The continued use of clay targets containing PAHs will lead to an increasing environmental load, and to further environmental and human exposure. Since PAHs are PBT and vPvB substances, the effects of the accumulation in the environment are unpredictable in the long term. Therefore, the characterisation of the emissions serves as a proxy for the risks."

    "text": "Article 1\nAnnexes I and II to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 are hereby replaced by the Annexes to this Regulation.\n\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1  January 1993.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 14  July 1992.\nFor the Commission  Christiane SCRIVENER Member of the Commission\nANNEX I\nPART ONE\nPRELIMINARY PROVISIONS\nSECTION I\nGENERAL RULES A. General rules for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature Classification of goods in the combined nomenclature shall be governed by the following principles :\n1. The titles of sections, chapters and sub-chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes and, provided such  headings or notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions.\n2. (a) Any reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a reference to that article incomplete or unfinished, provided that, as presented, the incomplete or unfinished article has the essential character of the complete or finished  article. It shall also be taken to include a reference to that article complete or finished (or falling to be classified as complete or finished by virtue of this rule), presented unassembled or disassembled.\n(b) Any reference in a heading to a material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to mixtures or combinations of that material or substance with other materials or substances. Any reference to goods of a given material or substance shall  be taken to include a reference to goods consisting wholly or partly of such material or substance. The classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance shall be according to the principles of rule 3.\n3. When by application of rule 2 (b) or for any other reason, goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows :\n(a) The heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description. However, when two or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or composite  goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale, those headings are to be regarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if one of them gives a more complete or precise description of the goods.\n(b) Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3 (a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or  component which gives them their essential character in so far as this criterion is applicable.\n(c) When goods cannot be classified by reference to 3 (a) or (b), they shall be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.\n4. Goods which cannot be classified in accordance with the above rules shall be classified under the heading appropriate to the goods to which they are most akin.\n5. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the following rules shall apply in respect of the goods referred to therein :\n(a) Camera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, drawing-instrument cases, necklace cases and similar containers, specially shaped or fitted to contain a specific article or set of articles, suitable for long-term use and presented with the  articles for which they are intended, shall be classified with such articles when of a kind normally sold therewith. This rule does not, however, apply to containers which give the whole its essential character.\n(b) Subject to the provisions of rule 5 (a) above, packing materials and packing containers (01)() presented with the goods therein shall be classified with the goods if they are of a kind normally used for packing such goods. However, this provision  is not binding when such packing materials or packing containers are clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n6. For legal purposes, the classification of goods in the subheadings of a heading shall be determined according to the terms of those subheadings and any related subheading notes and mutatis mutandis to the above rules, on the understanding that only  subheadings at the same level are comparable. For the purposes of this rule the relative section and chapter notes also apply, unless the context otherwise requires.\nB. General rules concerning duties 1. The customs duties applicable to imported goods originating in countries which are Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or with which the European Economic Community has concluded  agreements containing the most-favoured-nation tariff clause shall be the conventional duties shown in column 4 of the schedule of duties. Unless the context otherwise requires, these conventional duties are applicable to goods, other than those  referred to above, imported from any third country.\nThe autonomous duties shown in column 3 are applicable :\nwhen they are less than the conventional duties,\nor\nwhen no conventional duty exists, in which case a dash is shown in column 4.\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply where special autonomous customs duties are provided for in respect of goods originating in certain countries or where preferential customs duties are applicable in pursuance of agreements.\n3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not preclude the Member States from applying customs duties other than those of the Common Customs Tariff where the application of such other duties is justified by Community law.\n4. The duties expressed as percentage rates in columns 3 and 4 are ad valorem duties.\n5. The symbol 'AGR' appearing in column 3 opposite certain headings or subheadings denotes that the goods concerned are subject to levies.\nWhen the customs duty is followed by the sign '+' and the symbol 'AGR' for example '16 + AGR', the goods are subject to both duty and levy.\nWhen the customs duty is followed by the symbol '(AGR)', for example '20 (AGR)', the figure 20 refers to a rate of duty made obsolete by the introduction of the levy system.\n6. The symbol 'MOB' in columns 3 and 4 denotes that the goods concerned are chargeable with a 'variable component' determined under the regulations relating to trade in certain goods processed from agrícultural products.\n7. The symbol 'AD S/Z' or 'AD F/M' in column 4 in Chapters 17 to 19 and 21 indicates that the maximum rate of duty consists of an ad valorem duty plus an additional duty for certain forms of sugar or for flour. This additional duty is fixed in  accordance with the rules concerning trade in certain processed agricultural products.\n8. The symbol 'AD S/Z' in column 4 in Chapters 8 and 20 indicates that the Community reserves the right to charge, over and above the bound duty, an additional duty on sugar corresponding to the duty payable on imported sugar and applicable to the  quantity of various sugars contained in this product in excess of the percentage by weight laid down in the additional note to Chapter 8 and in additional notes 3 and 5 to     Chapter 20, or, in respect of products falling within heading Nos 0811 and  2006 to 2008 which exceed 13 % by weight.\n9. In heading No 2008, columns 3 and 4, the symbol '2 AD S/Z' indicates that the applicable rate of the additional duty on sugar is fixed at a standard rate of 2 % of the customs value of the goods.\n10. In Chapter 22 the symbol 'Ecu/% vol/hl' in columns 3 and 4 means that a specific duty, expressed in Ecus, is to be calculated for each percentage volume of alcohol per hectolitre. Thus a beverage having an alcohol content by volume of 40 % is to be  charged as follows :\n- 1 Ecu/% vol/hl = 1 ECU × 40, giving a duty of ECU 40 per hectolitre, or\n- 1 Ecu/% vol/hl + 5 Ecu/hl = 1 ECU × 40 plus ECU 5, giving a duty of ECU 45 per hectolitre.\nWhere, in addition, a minimum (MIN) value is shown, for example 1,6 Ecu/% vol/hl MIN 9 Ecu/hl, it means that the duty, calculated on the basis of the abovementioned rule, is to be compared with the minimum duty, for example ECU 9 per hectolitre, and  the higher of the two is to be applied.\nC. General rules applicable both to nomenclature and to duties 1. Unless provided otherwise, the provisions relating to customs value shall be applied to determine, in addition to the value for the assessment of ad valorem customs duties, the values by  reference to which the scope of certain headings or subheadings is defined.\n2. The dutiable weight, in the case of goods chargeable by weight, and the weights by reference to which the scope of certain headings or subheadings is defined, shall be taken to be :\n(a) in the case of a reference to 'gross weight', the aggregate weight of the goods and of all the packing materials and packing containers;\n(b) in the case of a reference to 'net weight' or simply to 'weight' without qualification, the weight of the goods themselves without packing materials and packing containers of any kind.\n3. Pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2779/78 (02)(), the equivalent in national currencies of the ecu by reference to which certain specific customs duties are expressed, or which is used as a criterion limiting  the scope of certain subheadings, shall be that obtaining on the first working day of October 1992 to be published in the 'C' series of the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nHowever, where a change in the bilateral central rate of one or more national currencies occurs the provisions of Article 2 (3) of the abovementioned Regulation shall apply.\nSECTION II"

Indications of cases of frustrating the Union’s restrictive measures could include, inter alia, the fact that the main activity of a third country operator consists of purchasing restricted goods in the Union that reach Russia, the involvement of Russian persons or entities at any stage, the recent creation of a company for purposes related to restricted goods reaching Russia, or a drastic increase in the turnover of a third country operator involved in such activities."

Conversely, it is not necessary to require the authorisation of individual recycling processes obtaining only plastic from a closed and controlled chain that prevents contamination, as the introduction of contaminants in the chain is then sufficiently controlled to ensure that the only contamination of the plastic input can be removed with the simple cleaning and heating processes needed in any case for the remoulding of the materials."

Considering that European research infrastructures are in competition with those of the Community’s global partners which are and will be strongly investing in modern large-scale research infrastructures, and that these infrastructures are becoming increasingly complex and expensive, often placing them beyond the reach of a single Member State or even continent, it is now necessary to exploit and develop the full potential of Article 171 of the Treaty by establishing a framework containing the procedures and conditions for the setting-up and operation of European Research Infrastructures at Community level which are necessary for the efficient execution of the Community’s RTD programmes.

Since salmon substitutes based onClupea harengusare intended as an alternative to salmon substitutes based onTheragra chalcogrammaandPollachius virens, the consumption of salmon substitutes by consumers should not significantly change.

    "text": "Article 57\nBenefits for an occupational disease where the person concerned has been exposed to the same risk in several Member States\n1. When a person who has contracted an occupational disease has, under the legislation of two or more Member States, pursued an activity likely to cause that disease, the benefits that he or his survivors may claim shall be awarded exclusively under the legislation of the last of these States whose conditions are satisfied, taking into account, where appropriate, the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3.\n2. If, under the legislation of a Member State, the granting of benefits in respect of an occupational disease is subject to the conditions that the disease in question was first diagnosed within its territory, such condition shall be deemed to be fulfilled if the disease was first diagnosed in the territory of another Member State.\n3. In cases of sclerogenic pneumoconiosis, the following provisions shall apply:\n(a) if under the legislation of a Member State the granting of benefits in respect of an occupational disease is subject to the condition that the disease in question was diagnosed within a specific time limit following cessation of the last activity which was likely to cause such a disease, the competent institution of that State, in examining the time at which such activity was pursued shall take into account, to the extent necessary, similar activities pursued under the legislation of any other Member State, as if they had been pursued under the legislation of the first State;\n(b) if under the legislation of a Member State the granting of benefits in respect of an occupational disease is subject to the condition that the activity likely to cause the disease in question was pursued for a certain length of time, the competent institution of that State shall take into account, to the extent necessary, periods during which such activity was pursued under the legislation of any other Member State, as if it had been pursued under the legislation of the first State;\n(c) the cost of cash benefits including pensions shall be divided between the competent institutions of the Member States in whose territories the person concerned pursued an activity likely to cause the disease. This division shall be carried out in the ratio which the length of old age insurance periods completed under the legislation of each of the States bears to the total length of the old age insurance periods completed under the legislations of all those States at the date on which the benefits commenced.\n4. The Council shall determine unanimously, on a proposal from the Commission, the occupational diseases to which the provisions of paragraph 3 shall be extended.\n\nArticle 58\nCalculation of cash benefits\n1. The competent institution of a Member State whose legislation provides that the calculation of cash benefits shall be based on an average wage or salary shall determine such average wage or salary exclusively by reference to wages or salaries recorded during the periods completed under the said legislation.\n2. The competent institution of a Member State whose legislation provides that the calculation of cash benefits shall be based on a standard wage or salary shall determine such average wage or salary exclusively by reference where appropriate, the average of the standard wages or salaries corresponding to the periods completed under the said legislation.\n3. The competent institution of a Member State whose legislation provides that the amount of cash benefits shall vary with the number of members in the family shall take into account also the members of the family of the person concerned who are residing in the territory of another Member State, as if they were residing in the territory of the competent State.\n\nArticle 59\nCosts of transporting a person who has sustained an accident at work or is suffering from an occupational disease\n1. The competent institution of a Member State whose legislation provides for meeting the costs of transporting a person who has sustained an accident at work or is suffering from an occupational disease, either to his place of residence or to a hospital, shall meet such costs to the corresponding place in the territory of another Member State where the person resides, provided that that institution gives prior authorisation for such transport, duly taking into account the reasons justifying it. Such authorisation shall not be required in the case of a frontier worker.\n2. The competent institution of a Member State whose legislation provides for the costs of transporting the body of a person killed in an accident at work to the place of burial shall, in accordance with the legislation which it administers, meet such costs to the corresponding place in the territory of another Member State where the person was residing at the time of the accident.\nSection 2\nAggravation of an occupational disease for which the benefit has\nbeen awarded\n\nArticle 60\n1. In the event of aggravation of an occupational disease for which a worker has received or is receiving benefit under the legislation of a Member State, the following rules shall apply:\n(a) if the worker has not, while in receipt of benefits, been in employment under the legislation of another Member State likely to cause or aggravate the disease in question, the competent institution of the first Member State shall be bound to meet the cost of the benefits under the legislation which it administers taking into account the aggravation;\n(b) if the worker, while in receipt of benefits, has been in such employment under the legislation of another Member State, the competent institution of the first State shall be bound to meet the cost of the benefits under the legislation which it administers without taking into account the aggravation. The competent institution of the second Member State shall grant a supplement to the worker, the amount of which shall be determined according to the legislation which it administers and shall be equal to the difference between the amount of benefits due after the aggravation and the amount which would have been due prior to the aggravation under the legislation which it administers if the disease in question had occurred under the legislation of that State;\n(c) if in cases covered by subparagraph (b) a worker suffering from sclerogenic pneumoconiosis or from a disease determined under Article 57 (4) is not entitled to benefits under the legislation of the second State, the competent institution of the first State shall be bound to provide benefits under the legislation which it administers, taking into account the aggravation. The institution of the second State shall, however, meet the cost of the difference between the amount of cash benefits, including pensions, due from the competent institution of the first State, taking into account the aggravation and the amount of the corresponding benefits which were due prior to the aggravation.\n2. In the event of aggravation of an occupational disease giving rise to the application of Article 57 (3) (c), the following provisions shall apply:\n(a) the competent institution which granted the benefits pursuant to Article 57 (1) shall be bound to provide benefits under the legislation which it administers, taking into account the aggravation;\n(b) the cost of cash benefits, including pensions, shall continue to be divided between the institutions which shared the costs of former benefits in accordance with Article 57 (3) (c). Where, however, the person has again pursued an activity likely to cause or to aggravate the occupational disease in question, either under the legislation of one of the Member States in which he had already pursued an activity of the same nature or under the legislation of another Member State, the competent institution of such State shall meet the cost of the difference between the amount of benefits due, taking account of the aggravation, and the amount of benefits due prior to the aggravation.\nSection 3\nMiscellaneous provisions\n"

It proposed to change the residue definition for both plant products and for products of animal origin. For other products it recommended raising or keeping the existing MRLs. It concluded that concerning the MRLs for beetroot, carrots, horseradish, parsnips, parsley root, salsify, swedes, turnips, onions, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, head cabbage, leek, beans (dry), lentils (dry), peas (dry), lupins (dry), linseed, peanuts, poppy seed, rape seed, mustard seed, gold of pleasure, barley grain, oats grain, rye grain, wheat grain and for all products of animal origin some information was not available and that further consideration by risk managers was required. As there is no risk for consumers, MRLs for those products should be set in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 at the existing level or the level identified by the Authority. Those MRLs will be reviewed; the review will take into account the information available within two years from the publication of this Regulation. The Authority also indicated that the existing MRLs for prothioconazole in sugar beet may raise concerns of consumer protection. The MRLs for this product should be set at the specific limit of determination or at the default MRL as set out in Article 18(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. In the context of a procedure for the authorisation of the use of prothioconazole on shallots, an application was submitted in accordance with Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 for modification of the existing MRLs. The Authority assessed the application and the evaluation report and recommended raising the existing MRL in its reasoned opinion(10). On 11 July 2015 the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), adopted a new Codex maximum residue limit (CXL) for cranberry, maize, potato, soya bean (dry) and sweetcorn(11). These CXLs should therefore be included in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 as MRLs. These CXLs are safe for consumers in the Union(12)."

For passion fruits/maracujas, cucumbers, gherkins and Chinese cabbages/pe-tsai the Authority concluded that the data gap previously identified was not addressed and that risk managers may consider maintaining those MRLs with the existing CXLs, available for cucumbers and gherkins or replacing those MRLs with the product specific LOD. As a fall-back GAP leading to an MRL safe for the consumers was available at the same level for cucumbers and gherkins it is appropriate to maintain those MRLs, while since for passion fruits/maracujas and Chinese cabbages/pe-tsai no fall-back GAP was available, then it is appropriate to lower these MRLs to the product specific LOD. For the sake of clarity, the respective footnotes indicating a lack of information concerning those products should be deleted from Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005."

security scheme for employed or self-employed persons;\n(ii) any person who is compulsorily insured for one or more of the contingencies covered by the branches of social security dealt with in this Regulation, under a social security dealt with in this Regulation, under a social security scheme for all residents or for the whole working population, if such person:\n- can be identified as an

concerned, complies with the definition given in Annex I;\n(iii) any person who is compulsorily insured for several of the contingencies covered by the branches dealt with in this Regulation, under a standard social security scheme for the whole rural population in accordance with the criteria laid down in Annex I;\n(iv) any person who is voluntarily insured for one or more of the contingencies covered by the branches dealt with in this Regulation, under a social security scheme of a Member State for employed or self-employed persons or for all residents or for certain categories of residents:\n- if such person carries out an activity as an employed or self-employed person, or\n- if such person has previously been compulsorily insured for the same contingency under a scheme for employed or self-employed persons for the same Member State;\n(b) frontier worker means any employed or self-employed person who pursues his occupation in the territory of a Member State and resides in the territory of another Member State to which he returns as a rule daily or at least once a week; however, a frontier worker who is posted elsewhere in the territory of the same or another Member State by the undertaking to which he is normally attached, or who engages in the provision of services elsewhere in the territory of the same or another Member State, shall retain the status of

referred to in Articles 22 (1) (a) and 31, by the legislation of the Member State in whose territory such person resides; where, however, the said legislations regard as a member of the family or a

Technical solutions, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (‘BECCS’), as well as nature-based solutions for capturing and storing CO2emissions may, where appropriate, be necessary. In particular, individual farmers, land and forest owners or forest managers need to be encouraged to store more carbon on their land and their forests, prioritising ecosystem-based approaches and biodiversity-friendly practices, such as close-to-nature forestry practices, set-aside areas, the restoration of forest carbon stocks, expansion of agroforestry coverage, soil carbon sequestration and restoration of wetlands as well as other innovative solutions. Such incentives enhance climate mitigation and overall emission reduction across sectors in the bio-economy, including through the use of durable harvested wood products, in full respect of ecological principles fostering biodiversity and the circular economy.

INTRODUCTION\nA. For the purpose of implementing Articles 5(3)(i) and 17(3)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, this Annex provides technical provisions on the type of information on detection methods that shall be provided by the applicant and that is needed to verify the preconditions for the fitness of the method. This includes information about the method as such and about the method testing carried out by the applicant. All guidance documents referred to in this Annex or produced by the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) shall be made available by the CRL.\nB. The method acceptance criteria and method performance requirements have been compiled by the European Network of GMO Laboratories (ENGL) in a document entitled \"Definition of minimum performance requirements for analytical methods of GMO testing\", which shall be made available by the CRL. \"Method acceptance criteria\" are criteria, which should be fulfilled prior to the initiation of any method validation by the CRL. The \"method performance requirements\" define the minimum performance criteria that the method should demonstrate upon completion of a validation study carried out by the CRL according to internationally accepted technical provisions and this in order to certify that the method validated is fit for the purpose of enforcement of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\nC. The CRL, established under Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and assisted by ENGL, will evaluate the provided information for its completeness and fitness for the purpose. Here, the method acceptance criteria recommended by ENGL, which are described under 1(B), will be taken into account.\nD. If the information provided about the method is considered adequate and fulfils the method acceptance criteria, the CRL will initiate the validation process for the method.\nE. The validation process will be carried out by the CRL according to internationally accepted technical provisions.\nF. The CRL, together with ENGL, shall provide further information about the operational procedures of the validation process and shall make the documents available.\nG. The CRL, assisted by ENGL, shall evaluate the results obtained in the validation study for the fitness for the purpose. Here, the method performance requirements as described under 1(B) shall be taken into account.\n2. INFORMATION ABOUT THE METHOD\nA. The method shall refer to all the methodological steps needed to analyse the relevant material in accordance with Articles 5(3)(i) and 17(3)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\nFor a particular material this must include the methods for DNA extraction and the subsequent quantification in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system. In such a case, the whole process from extraction up to the PCR-technique (or equivalent) constitutes a method. The applicant shall provide information about the whole method.\nB. As described in the document referred to under 1(B), ENGL recognises the modularity of a method. According to this principle, the applicant is allowed to refer to existing methods for a certain module(s), if available and appropriate. This could be, for instance, a DNA extraction method from a certain matrix. In such a case, the applicant shall provide experimental data from an in-house validation in which the method module has been successfully applied in the context of the application for authorisation.\nC. The applicant shall demonstrate that the method fulfils the following requirements.\n1. The method shall be event-specific and thus must only be functional with the GMO or GM based product considered and shall not be functional if applied to other events already authorised; otherwise the method cannot be applied for unequivocal detection/identification/quantification. This shall be demonstrated with a selection of non-target transgenic authorised events and conventional counterparts, in the case of GM plants. This testing shall include closely related events, where relevant, and cases where the limits of the detection are truly tested. The same specificity principle must be applied for products that consist of or contain GMOs other than plants.\n2. The method shall be applicable to samples of the food or feed, to the control samples and to the reference material, which is referred to in Articles 5(3)(j) and 17(3)(j) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\n3. The method shall be developed taking the following documents in consideration as appropriate:\n- General requirements and definitions: draft European standard prEN ISO 24276:2002,\n- Nucleic acid extraction prEN ISO 21571:2002,\n- Quantitative nucleic acid based methods: draft European standard prEN ISO 21570:2002,\n- Protein based methods: adopted European standard EN ISO 21572:2002,\n- Qualitative nucleic acid based methods: draft European standard prEN ISO 21569:2002.\nD. For the purpose of implementing Articles 5(3)(i) and 17(3)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, the applicant shall provide:\n(a) in the case of an application for authorisation covering a GMO, products consisting of or containing a GMO or products produced from a GMO, the event-specific quantitative detection method of the GM material;\n(b) in addition, in the case of an application for authorisation covering products produced from a GMO where the genetically modified material is detectable, the event-specific quantitative detection method in the foods or feeds produced from the GMO.\nE. The applicant shall provide a complete and detailed description of the method. The following points shall be clearly addressed.\n1. Scientific basis: An overview of the principles of how the method works, such as DNA molecular biology based (e.g. for real-time PCR) information must be provided. It is recommended to provide references to relevant scientific publications.\n2. Scope of the method: Indication of the matrix (e.g. processed food, raw materials), the type of samples and the percentage range to which the method can be applied."

    "text": "In order to ensure that the active account requirement contributes to the overarching objective of reducing excessive exposures to clearing services of substantial systemic importance provided by third-country CCPs and that the account is not dormant, a minimum number of derivative contracts should be cleared in the active accounts. Those contracts should be representative of the different subcategories of derivative contracts belonging to clearing services of substantial systemic importance (the ‘representativeness obligation’). The representativeness obligation should reflect the diversity of the portfolios of financial and non-financial counterparties subject to the active account requirement. Contracts with different maturities and different sizes should be cleared through the active accounts, as well as contracts of different economic nature, including all classes of interest rate derivatives that are subject to the clearing obligation under Commission Delegated Regulations (EU) 2015/2205(9)and (EU) 2016/1178(10)as regards those denominated in Polish zloty. To define the minimum number of derivative contracts that should be cleared through the active accounts, ESMA should identify up to three derivative classes amongst the derivative contracts belonging to the clearing services of substantial systemic importance. ESMA should further identify up to five most relevant subcategories of trades, per derivative class, based on a combination of size and maturity. Counterparties should then be required to clear at least five trades in the reference period in each relevant subcategory. The number of derivative contracts to be cleared should be at least five trades in the reference period on an annual average basis, meaning that in assessing whether counterparties fulfil the representativeness obligation, competent authorities should consider the total number of trades over a year. In order to ensure a proportionate approach and to avoid imposing an excessive burden on counterparties that have limited activity in the different subcategories of derivative contracts identified by ESMA, a de minimis threshold should apply to the representativeness obligation. In addition, the specific business model of Union pension scheme arrangements needs to be properly taken into account. In several cases, such arrangements have a limited number of interest rate derivatives trades, which are concentrated, long-term and with a high notional amount. That is why it is appropriate for a scaled-down representativeness obligation to be established, which should require one trade to be cleared instead of five in the most relevant subcategories per reference period. Member States should introduce appropriate periodic penalty payments for cases where a counterparty subject to the active account requirement fails to meet its obligations with regard to the operational criteria or the representativeness obligation."
